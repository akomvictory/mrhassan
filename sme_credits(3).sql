('agricultural machinery rental', 'According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), agricultural mechanization generally refers to the application of tools, implements, and powered machinery as inputs to achieve agricultural production. It encompasses various technologies across the production-processing chain from basic tools such as hoes and cutlasses to motorized equipment such as tractors and grain milling machines.\r\nAgricultural machinery and products refers to the machine used in doing various types of farm works. The use of machines in doing various types of work started during the industrialisation period in the middle ages culminated in the contemporary time. Understandably technology advanced and various types of machines for doing various work in the farm with automated technology was introduced,  With these machines, a lot of work can be accomplished just in few hours.  Industrial Supplies is product to be associated with some of the high quality brands being distributed internationally and in Nigeria\r\n', 'Nigeria needs to enhance the number of farmers who utilize mechanical power based mechanization in order to: \r\n• Increase the food production capacity of farmers leading to reduced poverty and improved livelihoods. \r\n• Reduce the drudgery associated with agricultural production. \r\n• Reduce the level of post-harvest losses that occur across different agricultural value chains.\r\n• Increase the prospects of the local agro-allied industry and the conversion of crops and tubers to Value Added Products (VAPs). \r\nAccording to FAO, there are three levels of agricultural mechanization: \r\n1.	Human Powered Sources This is the use of hand tools and manually operated equipment that rely on human power. Most of the activities in the agricultural sector in Nigeria are carried out with traditional equipment such as hoes and cutlasses. Human powered implements are the lowest level of mechanization, and result in limited agricultural productivity of farmers.\r\n2.	 Animal Power based Mechanization This is the use of animals such as horses, oxen, mules, donkeys and bulls to drive primary tillage implements and to transport farm produce. It is the second highest level of mechanization. The quantity of work achieved by draught animals varies considerably, but can be up to 5 to 20 times greater than human labour.\r\n3.	Engine Powered Machines Engine powered machines are the highest level of mechanization, obtaining energy from sources such as fossil fuels, wind or solar resources. According to FAO, a farmer dependent on agricultural mechanization can provide enough food to feed up to fifty people while a farmer using draught animal power can only feed six people. Given the drive towards attaining food security, there is increasing awareness and investment in the use of engine powered machines across the agricultural value chain in Nigeria\r\n', 'Several factors are behind this emerging demand for mechanization:\r\n•	Rapid urbanization leads to increased market demand for agricultural products such as cereals, which require more labor than other crops.\r\n•	Growth of medium-sized farms. Large farmers in Africa have historically used tractors for land preparation; now tractor ownership among medium-scale farmers has started to emerge. Tractors not only allow these farmers to expand the size of their farms, but also to provide plowing services for nearby farmers.\r\n•	Rising rural wages and seasonal labor shortages have driven up demand for mechanization among smallholders. The availability of tractor plowing services enables many small farmers to plant their crops on time.\r\nThe rising demand for mechanization and the increased number of medium-scale farmers owning tractors have created a private mechanization hiring market in Ghana and increasingly in other countries in Africa south of the Sahara, which allows tractor owners to fully utilize their machines while providing services to farmers who cannot afford their own tractors. Recent evidence from Africa and elsewhere suggests that a such a market is the most efficient mechanism for supplying mechanization\r\n', 'The International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) has conducted research and developed simple, cost effective processing machines built to function in the Nigerian landscape. For example, they developed a de-stoner that has the capacity to process and clean 5 tons of grains per hour, and ultimately reduces the drudgery associated with manual de-stoning. In addition, IITA has introduced local processing technologies across the cassava value chain that are driving the processing of cassava into value added products such as gari, ethanol and industrial starch.\r\nThe government favour massive investment in the important part of agriculture with several incentives like partnership with local, state and federal government. The CBN also provide financing for the purchase of critical agricultural machines for renting to finance such loans. They also come in single digit interest rates. Commercial and microfinance banks and also Bank of Agriculture, SMEDAN and others provide financing for such ventures. \r\nThe Federal Institute for Industrial Research also has a lot of innovations that are yet to be mechanized. Partnering with such government agencies for development and deployment of critical machines can only be possible through Public-Private Partnerships\r\n', 'The factors limiting the use of farm machines in West Africa can be discussed as follows:\r\n1.         Economic factors: Farm machines are not readily available in the country.\r\n2.         Poverty: Most of the farmers are poor and can not afford to buy or own farm machines.\r\n3.         Land tenure system: Land fragmentation and system of ownership like communal do not allow the use of farm machines.\r\n4.         Lack of spare parts: Lack of spare parts also hunder the use of farm machines.\r\n5.         Seasonality of operation: The seasonal nature of Agriculture in West African can render the machines idle for mouths and this can result to depreciation of the machines.\r\n6.         Ignorance: Many farmers are still ignorant of the use of farm machines and some are still reluctant to use them.       \r\n7.         Lack of extension agents: People to train and educate illiterate farmers are not enough to carry out their job.\r\n8.         Illiteracy of farmers: Most farmers are illiterate and cannot operate or use these machines.\r\n9.         Maintenance cost of the farm machine is high and cost of hiring the machines are also high.\r\n10.  Most of the machines are not adapted to our local soil type.\r\n11.  Lack of experts to handle the machine.\r\n12.  Peasant farmers have small fragment of farm land. \r\n'),
('agro food processing and packaging', 'Agro/Food Processing Industry means units which add value to agricultural produce, their intermediates and/or residues, and edible animal products by processing or by improving storability or by providing the link from farm to the market or part thereof. Agro Industry also comprises hi-tech agriculture; fish processing; honey processing; cold chain infrastructure; steel silos & warehouses for foodgrains\r\nFood processing plant means a commercial operation that manufactures, packages, labels or stores food for human consumption and does not provide food directly to a consumer. “Food processing plant” does not include any of the following:\r\nFood processing residuals means the remaining organic material from a food processing plant and may include whey and other dairy, cheese making, and ice cream residuals or residuals from any food manufacturing process excluding livestock or poultry slaughtering and rendering operations. “Food processing residuals” do not include food residuals from markets, groceries, or restaurants. \r\nProcessing aid means any substance not consumed as a food ingredient by itself, intentionally used in the processing of raw materials, foods or their ingredients, to fulfil a certain technological purpose during treatment or processing and which may result in the unintentional but technically unavoidable presence of residues of the substance or its derivatives in the final product, provided that these residues do not present any health risk and do not have any technological effect on the finished product\r\nMost currently successful Nigerian entrepreneurs rely on low-technology businesses that are relatively affordable. However, for more advanced processing solutions, Nigerian food processors are financially incapacitated. Unlike in the United States or Europe, in Nigeria, there is not a funding ecosystem comprised of grants, angel investors, and venture capitalists to approach for seed capital funding for promising new food products and business models. The only funding options available are traditional bank loans, with interest rates close to 30%; government-owned development bank funding is not reliable\r\n\r\n', 'Due to high and sustained investments in its agrofood & plastprintpack industry and its enormous expected population growth from currently 206 million to 411 million in 2050 (United Nations), it is all too likely that Nigeria will very soon become the No. 1 in Africa for imports of any technology. A position the country is likely to take in the long term.\r\nBecause an organized infrastructure for efficient and effective postharvest handling and storage (modern silos, cold chains, etc.) is lacking, a significant share of annual cereal and grain outputs is lost. In many cases, excessive amounts of preservatives are used, and residues exceed the 20 ppm threshold set by the World Health Organization. Vital primary processing facilities, such as industrial grain dryers and large-scale automatic grain sorting machines, are not available to help process the smallholder farmers’ raw grains and cereal outputs. These processing steps are much needed in order to meet the quality expectations of increasingly sophisticated Nigerian consumers and manufacturers, as well as for export markets.\r\nGrain and cereal outputs from these small farmers often contain pebbles and foreign materials that present serious challenges in sorting for small-scale packaged food manufacturers, who frequently lack sufficient funds to invest in extra sorting machinery. This lack of basic sorting technologies results in many consumers opting to purchase stone-free imported processed foods instead of Nigerian processed foods.\r\nIn addition, common practices by smallholder farmers, such as spreading grains on the ground for sun drying, exposes these locally processed foods to foreign materials and unpredictable rain showers, which result in high-moisture grains and inadvertent mold infestations. Thanks to the combined effect of an undeveloped food processing and manufacturing system, as well as a myriad of primary processing challenges, Nigeria is a net importer of food despite its high number of small farmers (PWC 2019)\r\n', 'Less than 5% of grains and cereals end up as postharvest losses in Nigeria, while more than 40% of fruits and vegetables end up as postharvest losses (Ubochi 2018). These include staple vegetables such as tomatoes, plantains, potatoes, oranges, and pineapples. This loss is the equivalent of $9 billion annually in Nigeria (AgroNigeria 2017). At the same time, fewer than 3% of the 150 million consumers in Nigeria who wish to consume more fruits and vegetables have regular access to them.\r\nProcessed foods are becoming more of a normal part of life in Nigeria thanks to factors that include rapid urbanization (a rate of 4.2% annually), a higher level of literacy that translates into rising income levels, rapidly increasing general population growth, and an even faster middle-class growth rate. In 2012 Nigeria’s processed food industry was valued at $20 billion annually and is expected to grow by several tens of billions of dollars by 2050 (USDA 2013). This growth projection does not account for the immediate West African sub-Saharan region with a population of about 200 million and the overall influences of Nigerian lifestyles on other sub-Saharan African countries. \r\nDespite this huge available market for processed, ready-to-eat foods (meals, snacks, and beverages), this industry remains highly underdeveloped. Most of these food processing companies offer only standard or conventional food products (mostly beverages, biscuits, and instant noodles) that are tailored to general global consumers with little or no consideration (or formulations) for the African or local palate.\r\nThis gap has created huge business opportunities for thousands of micro and small entrepreneurs in Nigeria. Since the early 2000s, using low-technology food processing unit operations, (such as efficient tray drying, ovens, deep fryers, and small bottling lines), trained Nigerian small business entrepreneurs have begun processing and packaging shelf-stable foods (mostly snacks and beverages) that are tailored to the African palate. Further advances to harness the full potential of this burgeoning industry, which offers great promise for financial returns, national productivity, and employment, are being hampered by one or a combination of the following critical gaps: lack of knowledge, lack of copackers, and lack of capital.\r\n', 'There are no barriers to entry in the country. As the country grapple with the reality of food insecurity all options are on the deck for consideration in ensuring their adequate food for the nation', 'Policy formulations and implementation have remained a major problem in the development of their Agro food Industry in the sub-Saharan African countries, including Nigeria. The required processing techniques to convert crops and tubers into VAPs are usually hampered because of non availability of necessary processing facilities, and when available the power required to run them is lacking or grossly Insufficient\r\n\r\n'),
('appiculture', 'Bees are one of the many insects in the world that can produce something that is beneficial to all of us. We obtain honey from these bees and as we all know, honey is an important food for human beings. Since ancient times, honey is used for treating several diseases, and it is an antioxidant, therefore beekeeping is an important activity\r\n“Apiculture is the scientific method of rearing honeybees. “\r\nThe word ‘apiculture’ comes from the Latin word ‘apis’ meaning bee. So, apiculture or beekeeping is the care and management of honey bees for the production of honey and wax. In this method, bees are bred commercially in apiaries, an area where a lot of beehives can be placed. Usually, apiaries are set up in areas where there are sufficient bee pastures – such as areas that have flowering plants\r\nIn a colony, there are 10,000 to 60,000 bees! But all of them do not collect nectar- there is a strict division of labour. The queen bee and female bees lay thousands of eggs. Larvae that hatch are fed royal jelly and the duration that they are fed will decide their role as a worker or queen. The drone bees are male and their job is only to help in fertilizing the eggs laid by the queen, and the worker bees do the actual work of collecting nectar\r\nA particular focus of USAID has been on women through user-friendly beekeeping technology. Between 2012 and 2017, when the program ended, USAID trained 1,200 bee farmers on beekeeping pollination services. USAID reports it also organized some 330 women into thirty beekeeping cooperatives. The USAID program targeted eight states particularly conducive to bee-keeping: Kaduna, Niger, Benue, Ondo, Cross River, Imo, Abia, and Edo. USAID’s Nigeria beekeeping project was small-scale.\r\n', 'The market for beekeeping and honey production is huge. From cosmetics, medicine, confectioneries, and the pharmaceutical industries, to religious groups, the demand for organic honey and other bi-products  is growing\r\n\r\nA honeybee pollinates 3/4th of the world`s angiosperm plants. It increased the yields of crops by 1/3rd that estimated to feed 1/3rd of human beings in Africa. Worldwide, honeybees were mainly kept for honey production that utilized for home consumption and sale (Aizen & Harder, 2009; Morse & Calderone, 2000). In 2011 alone, US$ 3.3 billion is obtained from naturally harvested honey (FAO 2015; Gallai et al., 2009) and played great roles in the economic growth of the producing countries (Thompson, 2012). Nevertheless, the valuable products and honeybee colonies decreased from time to time (Aizen & Harder, 2009; Van Engelsdorp & Meixner, 2010; Breeze et al., 2014; Cressey et al., 2014; Chantawannakul & Ramsey, 2018)\r\nThe decline of honeybee populations poses a great negative threat to agricultural production (Grossman, 2013). It is followed by the loss of important plant species, honeybee diversities, and disturbance of the natural ecosystem (Murray et al., 2009). These are caused by changes in honeybee population size, growth rate, and plant-pollinator network architecture. Therefore, conserving honeybee species without disturbing their natural habitats is very important (Murray et al., 2009). The United States National Agricultural Statistics authority indicated that honeybee declined from 6 million (in 1947) to 2.4 million (in 2008) hives (https://www.greenpeace.org/usa/sustainable-agriculture). Similarly, in the United states it declined from 60 to 26 from 1947 to 2008 (Ellis et al., 2010). In the last ten years, more than 30% of the annual honeybee hives declined in the United States and Europe (Wathome et al., 2013).\r\n', 'The statement cites data developed by USAID. It says, “according to the USAID beekeeping pollination project, Nigeria can generate over $10 billion from local and international trade in honey and other hive products as domestic consumption currently stands at 380,000 metric tons… On the other hand, the global monetary value of trade in honey alone stands at about $4.5 million. Apart from the present high and still growing demand, bee products are highly priced globally, especially in non-producer countries.\r\nExperts say that honeybees contribute an estimated $200 billion to the global economy through crop pollination and production of honey, beeswax and other bee products. In sub-Saharan Africa, beekeeping is important as a source of food, employment, environmental conservation and diversification of the export base.\r\n', 'There are some association with the industry like the bee keepers association of Nigeria, Federation of Bee Keepers in Nigeria are among some who lookout for the welfare of farmers. For commercial sales of honey, the NAFDAC certifications are required for it to be fit to be sold to both the local and international market. Individual countries also require varicose certification process for the things that they allow their citizen to eat. ', 'Apart from inadequate yield due to lack of investment, there is also the challenge of inadequate or poor infrastructure, such as roads and access to farm input. Right now, most bee farmers cannot access inputs and rural services and extension information to take advantage of its growing demand . There is also absence of coordination in form of farmers’ cooperatives to achieve scale\r\nMultiple factors contribute to honey bee colony loss:\r\n•	Diseases.\r\n•	Parasites.\r\n•	Pesticides.\r\n•	Long-distance transportation of colonies.\r\n•	Winter survival rates.\r\n•	Limited floral resources.\r\n•	Fluctuations in the honey market.\r\n'),

Processors of value-added beans products are available and able to export from Nigeria.\r\nBeans is one of the most popular and staple foods in Africa, especially in Nigeria and the 4th most consumed after cassava, yam, and rice, more of brown beans than black-eyed beans are abundantly cultivated by the majority of farmers in northern parts of Nigeria such as Borno, Gombe, Kano, Sokoto, Yobe and Zamfara State.\r\nBeans or cowpeas is a legume which is widely grown by farmers in various varieties and has about 32 species, it is in the plant family of Leguminosae. Beans are highly recommended to eat because of its numerous health benefits and nutritional values and also is the main protein source when compared to all other proteinous foods in Nigeria and most African countries.\r\nBeans are large and white, but can come in different colour like brown, red, dark red, black etc, it is kidney shaped and some spherical in shape but irrespective of their shape, size and colour, beans are highly nutritive and contain Vitamin A, protein, iron, vitamin B6, vitamin E and many more.\r\nIt takes about 7-14 days for it to grow and about 50-70 days (depending on the variety) for it to mature and mostly grows well in warm temperatures, the pod which holds the beans turns from green to dry yellow with the beans changing also from green to their mature colour.\r\nBeans can be grouped into 2 depending on their growth and time of harvest, namely: snap beans, shell beans, and dry beans.\r\nShell beans: When mature (especially the beans inside), the pods are removed and the edible seed meant to be eaten. It is good to know that this kind of beans before being cooked or dried must first of all be removed from its pod.\r\nShell or shelling beans is often treated as a vegetable in the kitchen and can be used to cook soup etc., and is similar to dry beans in terms of nutritional value. An example of shell beans is green shell beans such as Lima beans.\r\nSnap beans: This kind of beans are also known asstring bean or green beans; it is mainly grown for their seed but can be harvested and eaten with their pods basically before the seeds inside have fully mature. It is also classified into two namely, bush beans and pole beans\r\n', 'Nigeria is the number one world producer of dry beans. From our 4.5 million hectares land we are producing 58% of the global production. We can adapt to buyer demand. Our beans have a short gestation period due to the development of improved varieties. Adherence of good warehousing practices ensure storage and thus supply all year around\r\nNiger is the top region by production of bean in Nigeria. As of 2005, production of bean in Niger was 278.2 1000 metric tons that accounts for 18.50% of Nigeria\'s production of bean. The top 5 regions (others are Borno, Zamfara, Kaduna, and Sokoto) account for 55.78% of it. Nigeria\'s total production of bean was estimated at 1,503.9 1000 metric tons in 2005\r\n\r\n', 'The global dry beans market is projected to register a CAGR of 4.3% during the forecast period (2021-2026).\r\nDue to the Covid-19 outbreak and the imposing of lockdown restrictions, there has been a surge in demand for dry beans because of their long shelf-life. The global pandemic has made people health-conscious and improves their immune systems. Dry beans being considered as the best alternative source of protein and other nutrients had led to an increase in demand across the world. The sudden surge in demand has made it difficult to the producers to maintain a continuous flow of supply.\r\nIn 2019, Myanmar is the world\'s leading producer of dry beans, accounting for nearly 20.2% of the total output. In 2017, dry bean production declined, due to unfavorable weather conditions and uneven rainfall in the producing countries. The production of dry beans is majorly affected by several factors, such as environmental hazards, bio stress, and government policies of countries. Beans are subject to several bacterial and viral diseases as well, particularly at times of high temperature, high humidity, and heavy rainfall. Such unfavorable climatic conditions, along with diseases and pest infestation, often take a heavy toll on the yield of dry beans. Top global dry bean producers are Myanmar, India, Brazil, China, Mexico, Tanzania, the United States, Kenya, Uganda, and Rwanda. Major importers include India, China, Bangladesh, the United States, and Egypt.\r\n', 'Role of NEPC\r\nThe Nigeria Export Promotion Council widely supports (dry) beans trade from Nigeria. Key activities include:\r\n•	Supporting quality infrastructure\r\nThe NEPC provides capacity building programs for actors in the beans industry on compliance to food safety standards.\r\n•	Exporters’ directory\r\nThe NEPC provides a platform for prospective buyers to source for information on reliable exporters of (dry) beans.\r\n•	Exporter certificate verification portal\r\nBeing able to authenticate the export credentials of a company is a very important step in establishing confidence. The NEPC provides an electronic method of verifying the exporters’ certificate.\r\n•	Product map\r\nWhere location of products is important to a buyer, a display of geographical locations of products in states/regions in Nigeria is available. A buyer can have a firsthand view of the products available in different parts of the country.\r\n•	International Trade Shows\r\nPeriodically the Council presents opportunities for face to face contact between Nigerian sellers and international buyers of made in Nigeria products through participation in International Trade Fairs, Solo Exhibitions, Trade missions amongst others . This allows export deals to be concluded in a conducive environment\r\n', 'There are some associated risks with Beans among which are:\r\n1.History suggests a yield decrease for beans after beans. Planting soybeans back to back doesn’t automatically mean low yields, Kneubuhler says. However, past experience says beans after beans normally equates to a 5% to 15% potential yield loss compared to rotated ground.\r\n2. Don’t ignore soil fertility and nutrient requirements. “Soybeans are often planted and forgotten,” Kneubuhler says. “Soybeans will utilize about 40% more potassium than a corn crop. I recommend maintaining high soil fertility in a continuous soybean situation.” He adds, though, that data shows that adding nitrogen doesn’t equate to yield gain in soybeans.\r\n3. Soybean cyst nematode causes hidden losses on many farms. Typically, lighter exchange capacity soils carry a higher risk of building populations of soybeans cyst nematodes, Kneubuhler observes. “Keep in mind that planting soybeans back to back raises the risk of SCN.\r\n6. Variety selection is key to preventing potential yield loss. “Choose varieties with good disease resistance or tolerance,” Kneubuhler says. “Avoid placing the same variety back in the same field. Sometimes earlier-maturing varieties can miss disease pressure which tends to come on later in the season.”\r\n7. Don’t ignore the importance of weed control. “I highly favor a good residual program ahead of planting,” Kneubuhler says. “That’s particularly true in light of our current problems with marestail, Palmer amaranth and waterhemp. Don’t rely only on postemergence herbicides.”\r\n8. Don’t overlook insects. Whenever you vary the crop rotation, scout for insects — especially pod feeders like bean leaf beetles, rootworm beetles and Japanese beetles. Treat if needed. Kneubuhler says that in comparison to the alternative, insecticides are low-cost and proven to have a high return on investment.\r\n'),

('beef', 'There are over 1.1 billion cattle, in the world, many of which are used for work or milk production with beef production only a side issue of their major intended usefulness. All dairy cattle are beef cattle but not all beef cattle are dairy cattle. Most of the cattle produced strictly for beef are bound in North and South America, Australia and New Zealand. The distribution of the world cattle population is such that the leading beef producing countries are not necessarily the highest beef consumers per capital. In fact, 70% of the World cattle population is accounted for by only 20 countries. Cattle population however, appears to be increasing more rapidly in the topics than elsewhere. T\r\nNigeria has considerable livestock — nearly 20 million cattle, 40 million sheep and 60 million goats — but about 30 percent of slaughtered animals are purchased from abroad, mainly from neighbouring Cameroon, Chad, Mali and Niger.\r\nOften the herds are driven for hundreds of kilometres (miles) to be sold at border markets like Illela, a trading post between Niger and Nigeria.\r\nThe animals are then trucked to the cities, where they are sold again, slaughtered and butchered\r\n', 'The economic significance of beef and beef cattle industry has long been recognized since colonial era when our colonial master opened up a needed source of beef supply for Great Britain. This was as a result of an increasing concern when the world meat supply, especially in Britain, was diminishing, while demand was increasing due to population pressure. Beef industry has been making significant contribution to the National Economy of the country in that: - The beef industry offers employment opportunity to millions of Nigerians as: Cattle rearers, Cattle traders, Cattle trade middle men and women, Cattle drovers, Cattle transporters, Butchers, etc\r\nBesides, per capita consumption of animal protein is grossly below minimum required in this country. Thus there is prospect for marketability of the product – beef. There is ready market since Nigeria is no where near the FAO recommended requirement for animal protein consumption per day (7g vs 35g). The cattle breeds are adapted to the environment e.g. N’dama, WASH (West African short horn), Gudali, Kuri, Sanga, etc. There is vast grassland resources available in the country. Supplementary feeds are also available in the forest areas e.g agro-industrial by-products like DBG, wheat offal, rice bran, crop residues – sorghum, maize and wheat – stovers, groundnut and cowpea vines, etc, fodder trees – Gliricidia, Leucaena, Ficus spp, Gmelina, etc. There is large water bodies like rivers and lakes for regular and adequate water supplies. There is animal traction and transport in the Northern sector of the country e.g. bullock ploughing. There is less building requirement for the beef industry, hence low initial capital outlay. Beef animal production serves as financial security or collateral in times of need.\r\nOn security, The millennia-old activity has been thrust into the spotlight in recent years because of worsening confrontations with sedentary farmers over access to land and water.\r\nClashes have claimed 7,000 lives over the past five years and cost the Nigerian economy $13 billion (11.57 billion euros) annually, according to a report in May by the NGO Mercy Corps\r\nThe UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates the continent will experience a doubling in consumption of beef, pork and chicken between 2015 and 2050.\r\n', 'With over 200 million people and an emerging middle class, Nigeria is witnessing a boom in demand for meat that offers potential but also risks for the semi-nomadic herders who provide most of its beef.  According to government estimates, Nigeria, consumes 360,000 tonnes of beef each year, accounting for half of all West Africa. In per-capita terms, consumption is low compared with advanced economies, but it is growing fast, and expected to quadruple by 2050.\r\nToday, most of the demand is met by pastoralists from the ethnic Fulani group, who follow time-honoured techniques of raising cattle, driving them south to pastures and taking them to market.\r\nDuring the dry season, the herders come down from the arid Sahel to the fertile plains of central and southern Nigeria, seeking water and pasture for their livestock.\r\n', '\r\nSome associations that look into the affairs of the cattle breeders (Fulanis) is the Miyetti Allah Cattle breeders association of Nigeria. A major goal of MACBAN is to be the umbrella organization of Fulani herdsmen within the country. The activities of the organization involves liaising with the government on behalf of pastoralists, land use rights, nomadic education and conflict resolution between pastoralists and farmers. The group also supports protecting and increasing grazing reserves for cattle breeders in the country. However, not all pastoralists intend to stay within grazing reserves and the organization provides information to convince grazing reserve skeptics among the nomads to buy into the idea\r\nThe Nigerian Veterinary Medical Association is supposedly charged with the responsibility of  ensuring slaughterhouses to supply safe, hygienic and good quality beef products that meet domestic and international demands, Veterinarians have roles to play, in all stages of the meat value chain.\r\nThey are also central to combating diseases in livestock production through prevention, management, treatment and control, just as they monitor livestock movement, from market through control posts, to the slaughterhouses.\r\nQuoting Section 18(1) of the Animal Diseases (Control) Act CAP 17 LFN 2014: “Any person who establishes or intends to establish a hatchery or a poultry farm of up to 250 birds shall be required to obtain a licence for its establishment from the Chief Veterinary Officer of the state in which the hatchery or farm is situated”, Sunday said the Act mandates state CVOs, to regulate ranches and livestock farms.\r\n“Federal CVO regulates the importation and exportation of livestock and livestock products. The meat law of all the states in Nigeria mandates the state CVO to register abattoirs, while Vet Officers monitor and supervise the slaughter of animals and inspection of meat for public consumption.\r\n“Vets must be involved in production of healthy, clean and wholesome animals viz a viz feeds and feeding, breeding, upgrading, AI, management. They are also central to combating disease constraints in livestock production through prevention, management, treatment and control.” This is among some conciderations to be made in entering into the business of cattle breeding for whatever purpose\r\n', 'The problems of the Nigeria beef industry can be considered from: (a) National economy (b) Social and (c) Political aspects of the industry (d) Farmers-Herders Clashes. \r\nThere has never been any accurate means of estimating the level of production and beef consumption in the country. There is no records of private slaughtering. The records on government farms are disjointed or not properly kept. As such, lack of reliable statistics hampers our assessment of achievement or otherwise in beef industry. The production is short of the ever increasing national demand. The problems are extremely diverse – breeding, nutrition, production system, socio-economic and financial constraints. This is true even within Nigeria because of various climatic and ecological differences, ranging from hot savannah zone where livestock production is based on pastoral system to humid zones with high rainfall in the south where utilization of the abundant pasture resources and water is highly limited by tsetse flies and social land pressures.\r\nAnd of course, the security dimension that it is bringing into the country is no news. As  a result of climate change, there is a lot of preasure between herders and farmers who are competing for space on arable lands. These  had led to a lot of conflict and loss of lives in the country possing more threats to the already fragile food security raging in the country today. \r\nFurthermore, Nomadic herders also find themselves far from the channels of the meat trade, while many markets and outdoor slaughterhouses lack basic sanitary conditions, such as running water, animal shelters and cold storage rooms,\r\n\r\n'),

('cold room', 'A Cold room is a refrigerating chamber or cold room is a warehouse in which a specific temperature is artificially generated. It is generally designed for storing products in an environment below the outside temperature.\r\nProducts that need refrigeration include fruits, vegetables, seafood, meat, flowers. The first cold rooms were called snowfields. This was a well with retaining walls, of small or large dimensions, with openings where snow was introduced, and ice was extracted. The purpose was to keep the ice even if the snow melted.\r\nWhat applications do refrigerating chambers have?\r\nRegardless of the products they contain, these rooms are very useful for:\r\n•	Goods reception. The sanitary standards require that businesses, such as warehouses and restaurants, have an appropriate temperature to receive their raw materials, which will later be placed in different points. A good cooling system is crucial for these cases.\r\n\r\n•	Storage and products handling. This allows an increase in production and marketing, extending shelf life and enabling the transformation of products.\r\n\r\n•	Products display. In these cases, it is very common to use Walk in or Reach in doors, which allow the final consumer to easily access products and, at the same time, have a much more attractive point of sale.\r\nHow does refrigeration intervene in a cold room?\r\nRefrigeration slows chemical and biological processes in food, and controls deterioration and loss of quality.

In sub-Saharan Africa, cowpeas are produced mainly from West Africa, which accounts for 60% of worldwide production. \r\nCowpea is a major staple food crop in sub-Saharan Africa, especially in the dry savanna regions of West Africa. The seeds are a major source of plant proteins and vitamins for man, feed for animals, and also a source of cash income. The young leaves and immature pods are eaten as vegetables.\r\nThere is a big market for the sale of cowpea grain and fodder in West Africa. In Nigeria, farmers who cut and store cowpea fodder for sale at the peak of the dry season have been found to increase their annual income by 25%. Cowpea also plays an important role in providing soil nitrogen to cereal crops (such as maize, millet, and sorghum) when grown in rotation, especially in areas where poor soil fertility is a problem. It does not require a high rate of nitrogen fertilization; its roots have nodules in which soil bacteria called Rhizobia help to >x nitrogen from the air. \r\n', 'According to FAOSTAT (2017), cowpea was grown on an estimated 11 million ha in Africa in 2017 with most of production confined to West Africa (10.6 million ha), especially in Niger, Nigeria, Burkina Faso, Mali, and Senegal.

By this definition, zucchini, tomatoes, peppers, peapods, and even the seed pods of deciduous trees are fruits. Fruit is more commonly defined as the sweet, fleshy, edible parts of plants that contain the seed(s), excluding the non-sweet examples as zucchini, tomatoes and pepper. Vegetables, on the other hand, are broadly defined as the edible portions of a plant (excluding fruits and seeds), such as the roots, tubers, stems and leaves, a common definition which excludes sugar crops such as sugarcane and sugar beet as well as starchy root crops such as cassava, yams, and taro\r\nA fruit develops from the flower of a plant, while the other parts of the plant are categorized as vegetables.\r\nFruits contain seeds, while vegetables can consist of roots, stems and leaves.\r\nFrom a culinary perspective, fruits and vegetables are classified based on taste. Fruits generally have a sweet or tart flavor and can be used in desserts, snacks or juices.\r\nVegetables have a more mild or savory taste and are usually eaten as part of a side dish or main course\r\nThough there are many fruits that are mistaken for vegetables, there are very few vegetables that are considered fruits, if any.\r\nHowever, some vegetable varieties have a naturally sweeter flavor than most other vegetables and are used similarly to fruits in desserts, pies and baked goods.\r\nSweet potato pie is a dessert that is a traditional part of Thanksgiving in the United States. Despite their sweet flavor, sweet potatoes are actually a type of root vegetable, not a fruit.\r\nSimilarly, candied yams are a baked dish containing yams, another type of edible tuber. Other vegetables with a naturally sweeter flavor include beets, carrots, rutabagas and turnips.\r\n', 'In 2019, vegetables primary production for Nigeria was 16.7 million tonnes.

However, the production and marketing of these commodities take place in an environment characterized by highly variable biophysical, economic, political and institutional conditions, which poses several types of risk. It is also important to note that, risk perceptions generally play key roles in the production, investment and marketing behaviour of farmers\r\nDamage by pest and disease, traditional methods of farming and weather dependency were the most perceived sources of production risk by the fruit and vegetable farmers. Perishability of produce, low price of produce, poor product handling and packaging as well as exploitation by middlemen were the most perceived  sources of market risk.

Africa accounts for about 33.1% and Nigeria with 49 117 654 heads represents about 4.7 percent of the world output (FAOSTAT, 2014). Goats have the ability to withstand harsh climatic conditions and contrary to sheep that are grazers, goats are browsers that feed mostly on shrubs and tree leaves in adverse environments with low fertility lands usually unfit for growing crops. This makes goat keeping a good strategy for valorizing marginal resources (IFAD, 2012). In Nigeria, goats are reared mostly for meat. It is an important source of protein for both the rich and poor and a food delicacy highly appreciated during ceremonies and festivals, most especially in the southwestern zone of the country. Goats are kept by smallholder farmers as pets and serve as means of savings and income, especially among the economically vulnerable groups like women. It was reported that majority of Nigerians prefer to eat more of goat meat than beef (Nnaemeka, 2013) and demand always exceeds supply (Okewu and Iheanacho, 2015).\r\nSheep and goats (small ruminants) form an important economic and ecological niche in the agricultural systems. They form an integral and important component of the pattern of animal production in most rural communities. Sheep and goats are mainly kept for immediate cash source, milk, meat, wool, manure, and saving or risk distribution. They significantly contribute to the socio-economic life of many rural, peri-urban and urban poor households through provision of income, animal protein and intangible benefits (i.e., savings, an insurance against emergencies, cultural and ceremonial purposes).

PPR control is expected to reduce mortalities substantially, and may thus increase animal numbers and heighten demand for feed. Larger animal populations, in combination with future pressure to control animal movement around villages, gardens and farms, will likely result in some form of animal confinement.

('heliculture', 'Snail farming in Nigeria is one of the most lucrative agricultural business ideas for young entrepreneurs in Nigeria. Snail farming is a practical and viable business venture that is yet to be fully explored in Nigeria and the rest of Africa.\r\nSnail farming may not be the first thing that jumps to mind when thinking of profitable businesses to start in Nigeria. This post will open your eyes to the amount of hidden-wealth that can be realized by starting a snail farming business in Nigeria.\r\nHeliciculture, commonly known as snail farming, is the process of raising edible land snails, primarily for human consumption or cosmetic use. The meat and snail eggs can be consumed as escargot and as a type of caviar respectively. Mucus, commonly known as snail slime, has medical properties and is used in cosmetics.\r\nPerhaps the best known edible land snail species in the Western world is the Helix pomatia, commonly known as the Roman snail or the Burgundy snail. This species is however not fit for profitable snail farming, and normally harvested from nature.\r\nSnail Farming in Nigeria is very lucrative, and many Nigerians are beginning to see the gold mine in snail farming business. Snail farming is still very under-exploited in Nigeria. How many popular snail farms do you know? Few.\r\nIn Nigeria there are various breeds of snail and they are milk snail (Otala lacteal), white garden snail (Theba pisana), garden snail (Cornu aspersum), Burgundy snail (Helix pomatia) and the most popular African giant snail (Achatina achatina). The giant Africa snail is the best species for heliculture due to its prolificacy and economic size. it takes up to 2 years for snails to be sellable. The brim of the shell of a snail tells if it is matured or not. The thicker and harder the shell, the more mature it is. Once the snails are matured, you can sell the snails and keep a few for breeding\r\n', 'The market opportunity for snail farming in Nigeria and in Africa is huge but grossly underrated. Snails are a huge part of the diet in many parts of Africa, although they are not always affordable and available all year round. If you rear snail in commercial quantity, hotels, and fast food restaurants will be your regular customers.\r\nRaising snails for food is called heliculture. Snails are hermaphroditic and this means that each snail has both the male and female reproductive organs to reproduce fertile eggs. Snail is a very healthy source of protein, phosphorus, calcium and iron, and low in fats, sodium and cholesterol. There are many species of edible snails, and they vary in shape, size and colour. \r\nSnails lay eggs between ages eight and 12 months when they are sexually mature, the fertile eggs hatch between four and six weeks. They don’t have a defined breeding period, and on average they lay five to six clutches of eggs per year, containing on average 200 eggs per clutch if there are the right conditions. After hatching, the baby snail stays in the soil for two to five days. The prolific nature of reproduction and the market value (high demand) of snail would compensate farmers for its long maturity period of about two years. The hatchlings should be put in a separate pen to give them available space to grow and maximum protection.\r\nYou can keep your present job and do this on part time since it doesn’t require much time. To start a commercial snail business of 100 snails, about N70, 000 is required because you require N20, 000 for the snail pen and about N50, 000 for the seed snails. A mature snail can fetch from as much as N300 to N800 in the market, depending on the size and season\r\n', 'In Nigeria, the prices of raw, matured snails go for N250 to N600 depending on the size. However, the annual demand for snail in Nigeria is about 7.5million kg annually. The international trade in snails is flourishing in Europe and North America. The United State America imports more than $4million worth of snails annually from all over the world, including Nigeria.\r\nFor many years now, snails handpicked from the farm or bush has been the only way to get snails to the market and dinner table. Currently, the demand for snail is higher than the supplies, an indication that the market potential of snail is inexhaustible, locally and internationally. Starting both small and large scale snail farming businesses in the only way to fill up the spaces between the demand for snail and its supply in Africa.\r\nHumans have been consuming snails for thousands of years. Snails are very high in proteins, iron, and water, while being low in fat. Snail consumption is popular in various countries around the world. Currently, the global snail farming or heliciculture industry achieves sales of greater than $12 billion annually. Let’s take a closer look at the consumption of snails and the basics of starting a snail farm.\r\nSnail consumption and cultivation are popular to varying degrees in France, the U.S., Turkey, China, Indonesia, Italy, Spain, as well as African countries including Algeria, Cote d’Ivoire, Nigeria, and Ghana.

Others use variations, such as career and technology education and professional-technical education, and several states include the word workforce in describing these programs. The changes in terminology reflect a changing economy, in which technical careers have become the mainstay.\r\nIn the light of the foregoing, vocational education had a very unpopular beginning in Nigeria.

Maize is one of the important grains in Nigeria, not only on the basis of the number of farmers that engaged in its cultivation, but also in its economic value. Maize is a major important cereal crop being cultivated in the rainforest and the derived savannah zones of Nigeria. Maize has been in the diet of Nigerians for centuries. It started as a subsistence crop and has gradually become more important crop. Maize has now risen to a commercial crop on which many agro-based industries depend on as raw materials (Iken and Amusa, 2004). Maize is highly yielding, easy to process, readily digested and cost less than other cereals. It is also a versatile crop, allowing it to grow across a range of agro ecological zones (IITA, 2001). It is an important source of carbohydrate and if eaten in the immature state, provides useful quantities of Vitamin A and C. Maize thrives best in a warm climate and is now grown in most of the countries that have suitable climatic conditions\r\nIn 2020, maize production for Nigeria was 10,000 thousand tonnes. Maize production of Nigeria increased from 931 thousand tonnes in 1971 to 10,000 thousand tonnes in 2020 growing at an average annual rate of 7.29%. Maize is a major cereal and one of the most important food crops in Nigeria. Its genetic plasticity has made it the most widely cultivated crop in the country from the wet evergreen climate of the forest zone to the dry ecology of the Sudan savanna. Being photoperiod insensitive, it can be grown any time of the year, giving greater flexibility to fitting into different cropping patterns. It is one of the dominant cereal crops in the Guinea and Sudan savannas in northern Nigeria. Over the years, maize has become an important crop, taking over acreages from traditional crops such as millet and sorghum. In 2018, about 10.2 million tons of maize was produced from 4.8 million hectares, making Nigeria the highest producer in Africa (FAO, 2018)\r\n', 'The USDA data also shows that Nigeria’s yearly national production figure doubled between 1999 when the country returned to democracy and 2019, and that the figures in the last five years are the highest ever.

('oil palm', 'oil palm, (Elaeis guineensis), African tree in the palm family (Arecaceae), cultivated as a source of oil. The oil palm is grown extensively in its native West and Central Africa, as well as in Malaysia and Indonesia. Palm oil, obtained from the fruits, is used in making soaps, cosmetics, candles, biofuels, and lubricating greases and in processing tinplate and coating iron plates. Palm kernel oil, from the seeds, is used in manufacturing such edible products as margarine, ice cream, chocolate confections, cookies, and bread, as well as many pharmaceuticals. The cake residue after kernel oil is extracted is a cattle feed. The plant is also grown as an ornamental in many subtropical areas.\r\nPalm oil is of strategic importance as it is used in the production of more than half of the products sold in supermarkets globally. Nigeria is the largest consumer of palm oil in Africa with a population of 197 million people (World Bank, 2018). The nation consumed approximately 3 million MT of fats and oils in 2018, with palm oil accounting for 44.7% or 1.34 million MT. In the same period, production stood at 1.02 million MT resulting to supply shortfall of 0.32 million MT (excluding possible impact of palm oil exports). In the early 1960s, Nigeria was the world\'s largest palm oil producer with global market share of 43%. Today, it is the 5th largest producer with less than 2% of total global market production of 74.08 million MT. In 1966, Malaysia and Indonesia surpassed Nigeria as the world\'s largest palm oil producers. Since then, both countries combined produce approximately 80% of total global output, with Indonesia alone responsible for over half i.e. 53.3% of global output. According to the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), if Nigeria had maintained its market dominance in the palm oil industry, the country would have been earning approximately $20 billion annually from cultivation and processing of palm oil as at today\r\nNigerian States that are considered to be the largest producers of palm oil are Akwa-Ibom, Abia, Rivers, Edo, Imo, Ondo, Bayelsa, Cross River and Delta\r\n', 'Nigeria is the fifth-largest producer of palm oil globally with less than two per cent of total global market production. About 80 per cent of palm oil production in the country comes from dispersed smallholder farmers. The commercial palm oil industry rapidly expanded in the late 20th century and led to the deforestation of significant swaths of Indonesia and Malaysia as well as large areas in Africa. New plantations are often formed using slash-and-burn agricultural methods, and the resulting fragmentation of natural forests and loss of habitat threatens native plants and animals. Today, Nigeria being fifth largest palm oil producing country, with 1.5% or 1.03 million metric tonnes of the world\'s total output, according to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA).\r\nGlobal production of palm oil has increased rapidly since the 1990s, with plantations in Indonesia and Malaysia supplying around 85 percent of the global trade.\r\nAccording to the Hamburg-based Oil World trade journal, in 2008 global production of oils and fats stood at 160 million tonnes. Palm oil and palm kernel oil were jointly the largest contributors, accounting for 48 million tonnes, or 30% of the total output. Soybean oil came in second with 37 million tonnes (23%).\r\nOutlook for palm oil prices was dampened in 2019 with World Bank forecasting downward trend in the commodity price from US$639/MT in 2018 to US$623/MT. Prices have picked up in 2020 despite the disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic and it is anticipated to continue to grow and reach US$900 by 2026.\r\nAccording to Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) data showed production increased by over 400% between 1994 and 2004, to over 8.7 million metric tonnes. Indonesia is the world’s largest producer of palm oil, surpassing Malaysia in 2006, producing more than 20.9 million tonnes, a number that has since 2016 output, risen to over 34.5 million tons and it expects to double production by the end of 2030.\r\n', 'Nigeria imports nearly half of the five million tons consumed annually in the country.  Nigeria’s current local requirement for palm oil generally is about three million metric tonnes, but that it is producing only about 1.02 metric tonnes of oil palm.

The palm oil mill usually consists of sterilizing (boiling) machine, threshing machine, digesting machine, pressing machine, crude palm oil clarification machine, etc. Depending on how many tons do you want to process one day, the machines you need may vary. Each palm oil mill has a capacity rating, that is an amount of palm oil it can process daily. Medium palm oil mill usually produce about 1 -5 tonnes palm fruit every hours.\r\nThe most common machines found in a palm oil mill are the palm fruit sterilizer, palm fruit thresher, palm fruit digester, palm oil press machine, crude palm oil clarification machine, boiler, and so on. If your budget is enough, you can buy the whole palm oil processing machine. But if your budget is limited, you can use manual laborers to replace the palm oil machine. For example the threshing is left to manual laborers, you wouldn’t need a thresher. But of course there would be a wide gap when it comes to efficiency between the workers and the machine. Palm oil processing machines will perform faster and reduce waste significantly.\r\nThe production of palm oil in Nigeria started with trees, in which the fruits could be produced, harvested, and processed. Nigeria has two major types of palm oil production namely: the planted farms and the wild grove, but the second produces almost eighty percent of the fruit in totality. The three types of oil palm trees that can be found in Nigeria are namely Pisifera, Dura, and Tenera. The preferred variety to farmers of oil palm is Tenera which is Dura (female) and the Pisifera (male) highbred. It is the Nigeria Institute for Oil Palm Research (NIFOR) that produced Tenera seedlings (EWS) (PIND, 2011). The palm oil production is categorised into three groups of smallholders, medium and large-scale plantation (Ayodele and Ehalomi, 2010). Nonetheless, the abundance of resources for palm oil production in Nigeria still is under critical condition due to the long-time of palm oil industry producing and competing\r\n', 'The global palm oil market demand was estimated at 74.6 million tons in 2019 and is projected to register a volume-based CAGR of 2.3% from 2020 to 2027.

Palm Oil Investigations states that palm oil is used in nearly 50% of all consumer products sold on a daily basis.  Increasing disposable income and rising per capita expenditure on consumer products across the geographies is driving the demand\r\nGrowing concerns regarding the large-scale deforestation caused by widespread plantation have resulted in the introduction of stricter regulations governing plantation across the geographies. This factor is expected to impact market growth negatively by decreasing the plant cultivation area and yield.\r\nConsequently, Sustainable Palm Oil Production Program (SPOPP) was launched by the governing bodies in order to control deforestation and consequent plant diversity losses. Further, the adoption of new technologies such as advanced satellite-based technology that helps monitor deforestation has assisted to cater to the above mentioned market growth restraints and is expected to create new opportunities of development for the market. It is further accelerated by the growing manufacturer’s focus towards sustainable and organic cultivation.\r\n', 'Nigeria’s estimated annual palm oil consumption is 2.4 million tons. Yet, the country has a deficit of 0.9 million tons of palm oil. Specially in the south east and south west of the Nigeria.

They have to import from Asian countries and other foreigners that do not grow half as much as we do. All these singals show that investing in palm oil processing business is a highly profitable business\r\nWorldwide production of palm oil has been climbing steadily for five decades. Between 1995 and 2015, annual production quadrupled, from 15.2m tonnes to 62.6m tonnes. By 2050, it is expected to quadruple again, reaching 240m tonnes. The footprint of palm oil production is astounding: plantations to produce it account for 10% of permanent global cropland. Today, 3 billion people in 150 countries use products containing palm oil. Globally, we each consume an average of 8kg of palm oil a year.\r\nOf this, 85% comes from Malaysia and Indonesia, where worldwide demand for palm oil has lifted incomes, especially in rural areas – but at the cost of tremendous environmental devastation and often with attendant labour and human rights abuses. Fires set to clear forests and create land for more palm plantations are the top source of greenhouse gas emissions in Indonesia, a country of 261 million people. The financial incentive to produce more palm oil is helping to warm the planet, while destroying the only habitat of Sumatran tigers, Sumatran rhinos and orangutans – driving them towards extinction.\r\nYet consumers are often unaware they are even using the stuff.

('piggery', 'Pig farming which is also known as piggery is a lucrative aspect of farming in Nigeria that can pull cash to your bank account on a daily basis. If you’re into pig farming, you can attest to the fact of never lacking money again. The primary reason why you’ll make money from this business is due to the high demand of pork meat in Nigeria and the meat sells fast in the market. Another reason to consider this business is that pigs reproduce in large numbers and grow super-fast.\r\nThe pig industry in Nigeria is an important arm of the livestock sub-sector in the overall agricultural sector. This assertion derives from the fact that porcine production, among other species has a high potential to contribute to high economic gain in three ways. First, the pigs have high fecundity, high feed conversion efficiency, early maturity, short generation interval and relatively small space requirement. Secondly, they are multipurpose animals providing about 40% of meat in the world market, cooking fats and bristles. Pig is equally important for agro-based industries like feed mills for provision of bone and blood which are used for production of bone meal and blood meal respectively, which are good source of calcium in animal nutrition. In addition, pig\'s manure is an excellent fertilizer for enriching poor soils and provision of biogas methane for cooking. Its skin is also useful for light leather production (Babatunde & Fetuga, 1990). Thirdly, it is produced under a variety of production systems ranging from simple backyard piggery, pigs living on garbage belts to family operated farms or large scale integrated pig industries with sophisticated biosafety measures. Pig production has been ticked as a panacea to protein inadequacy due to certain attributes which pigs possess that are not in other domestic livestock. According to FAO (2001), pork is believe to be the most popular meat consumed in the world today. Forty four percent of world meat protein consumption is derived from pork and pork products (FAO, 2001). The people of Nsukka also have high value for pig because it is one of the requirements in their marriages and burial rites, many other feast and festivals have special provision for pork meat. Unfortunately, pigs in most cases are left to the small scale native farmers who traditionally leave the animals to scavenge with minimal attention for their lives. This system is characterized by high mortality rate, absence or minimal healthcare and improper housing and feeding (Ugwu, 1996). This has led to poor production and improvement of the pigs in areas which encourage spread of disease, low fecundity and low meat yield. According to Karrol and Krider (2001), free ranging of pigs is considered as one of the risk factors for porcine cysticerosis. Therefore, it is imperative to find ways to keep pigs enclosed. Economic studies have shown that traditional production system is wasteful and unprofitable due to poor feed conversion, high mortality rates, low reproductive rates and final products (Verhulst, 1993).\r\n', 'Just one pig can give birth to as much as 12 piglets at a time, making it one of the most reproducing farm animal in the world. Piglets are also called shoat or farrow. A male pig is also known as Boar while the female is a sow. A group of pigs is called a herd or drove.\r\nDespite the huge ROI in pig farming, a lot of Nigerians are still ignorant and adamant about this billion-dollar business. While some still doubt the profitability of this business, the few Nigerians who are in the business can tell you that this is the right business to start and smile to the bank daily.\r\nAs a pig farmer, you can sell a fully grown pig for as high as N35,000 depending on the weight. Now, imagine if you can rear at least a 100 pigs to maturity, you’ll be making nothing less than N3.5 Million from the sales. If you can rear like 2000 pigs a year, you will be making roughly N60 Million. Considering how fast pigs reproduce, it won’t be hard to rear 100 pigs in a year.\r\n', 'Fresh indications have emerged that Pork accounts for about $3 billion of consumption value in Nigeria and Ghana alone.

('plantain', 'With an annual production of 2.4 million metric tons, Nigeria is one of the largest producers of plantain in West Africa. Plantain production in Nigeria is concentrated in the southern parts of the country, contributing significantly to rapid food security as the third important starch staple after maize and cassava.\r\nPlantain belongs to the family Musaceae and the genus Musa. They are tree-like perennial herbaceous plants 2 to 9m tall, with an underground rhizome or corn. The principal species are Musa paradisciaea (French plantain). M. acuminate (Gross, Michel and Cavendish) and M. corniculata (Horn plantain).The physical appearance of plantain is greenish in color (the outer covering pod), it is slightly curve in length and when ripped, has dark or yellowish color with dark patches. When plantain is peeled, the inner fruit is slightly yellowish and cannot be eaten raw except it is cooked or allowed to go through the process of ripening. It can be cooked, roasted, baked or fried depending on the mode applied for preparation and intended form to be eaten.Nearly all edible plantain cultivar are derived from two wild species, M. acuminate and M. balbisiana (Robinson, 1996). These wild species are classified on the basis of the proportion of the genetic constitution contributed by each parental source (Robinson, 1996)\r\nBananas and plantains follow similar growth patterns, requiring about two and a half to four months after shooting before the fruit becomes ready for harvesting, or a total of approximately eight to twelve months after planting. At maturity, the fruit maintains a constant weight for two to four days, then the weight starts to decrease with changes in the peel color from green to yellow and then to black. The maturity of the fruit may be determined by the weight of the pulp to peel ratio, brittleness of floral ends and disappearance of angularity of the fingers\r\n', 'According to Food and Agricultural Organization Statistics (FAOSTAT, 2011), plantain production in West Africa is considerably higher than banana production. In 2011, 12.46 million metric tons (MT) of plantains were produced, representing 32.0% of worldwide production, compared to 2.47 million MT of bananas, representing only 2.3% of worldwide production. the highest producing individual countries in the region along with production for West Africa as a whole with Nigeria coming after Ghana and Cameroun. Worldwide, seven of the top ten plantain producing countries are in Sub-Saharan Africa, including the West African countries of Ghana, Cameroon, Nigeria, and Côte d\'Ivoire (EPAR, 2013). Available trade records and associated indices showed that Nigeria is one of the largest producers of plantain in the world (FAO, 2006).\r\nStatistics from worldatlas ranks Nigeria fifth in the world, behind Cameroon, Ghana, Uganda and Colombia in plantain production. The country produces an estimate of 3.09 million tons of plantains by both small-scale farmers and large-scale farmers\r\n', 'There is already a demand-supply gap of 99,800metric tons (MT) for plantains in Nigeria, which presents an opportunity for entrepreneurs.\r\nA recent plantain report by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation puts Nigeria’s plantain flour production at 25, 200 metric tons (MT) and estimated demand at 125,000MT\r\nThe growing number of plantain chips producers is believed to be responsible for the high demand experienced currently in the country, which also explains its potential for growth.\r\nThe Guardian learnt that aside boiling, plantain could be processed into pastry, pastry mixed with beans, fried plantains, plantain fritters and chips.\r\nIt was further learnt that jams, marmalades, juice, vinegar, beer and alcohol could be made from ripe plantain fruits.

In Nigeria according to (Hahn, 1991), most plantains and bananas are produced in the kitchen garden, on areas ranging from 0.5 to 1.8ha. This leads to demand which far outweighs supply in the country. This is because farmers still adhere to the traditional practice of producing their crops at their backyard or where it incidentally grows and they do not have access to improved cultivars of plantain and bananas (Nwaiwu et al 2012). Other problems which militate against the production and marketing of plantains and bananas include, lack of adequate information due to lack of extension services (IITA, 1996). Other problems include Pest and diseases, cultural practices, lack of storage facilities\r\n'),
('plastic recycling', 'Waste management is one of Nigeria\'s greatest challenges. These wastes are in form of polymers and plastics which research has shown that they are difficult to manage. One major factor that leads to poor waste management in Nigeria is due to the higher population density. Manufacturing plastics and plastic products has increased this year and higher than any other amount recorded in the world. Its production increased in just one year by 13million tons between the year 2015 and 2016. Fifty percent of the plastic products fall within the disposable products category since they are single-use plastic products and packaging materials.', 'Because 2020 was the year when most people spent their time inside, the domain of e-commerce experienced tremendous growth. But the waste generated by online orders is even higher than before. To reduce it, companies are turning their attention towards recyclable packaging materials.\r\nThis is a trend that will slowly conquer the industry of food delivery, one that generates huge amounts of waste that comes only from the packaging. Even though not all versions of packaging will be compostable, businesses need to shift to ones that are easier to be recycled than the actual forms. This means to shift to cardboard boxes, compostable and recycled paper, and lighter versions of plastic that can be recycled.\r\n', 'More plastic has been produced in the last years than was produced in the previous years. Globally, plastics demand rose from over 320 million tons in 2015 to more than 330 million tons in 2016 alone. This implies that plastic waste is rapidly increasing its damage on all ecological systems and life, therefore the demand for plastic recycling is increasing.', 'Considering the huge impact of plastic pollution on the oceans and aquatic lives, the Federal Government has been urged to enact a law regulating the use, disposal of plastics and protect the marines.', 'Waste and recyclable materials generate a lot of dust that can have serious health consequences. This dust can contain micro-particles of plastics, glass, biohazards, toxic substances such as asbestos or silica, and other respiratory irritants.'),
('poultry', 'This increase in production of poultry meat and projected increase is base on the increase in the number of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) involved in poultry farming value chain over the years. Despite the increase in the number of MSMEs involved in poultry value chain, and government ban on importation of frozen poultry products, Nigeria still import poultry meat from other countries which is translated to about $3 billion annual expenditure on imported frozen poultry meat across the land borders.\r\nExperts are of the opinion that poultry farming in Nigeria is on verge of collapse due various challenges confronting the sector. These challenges range from high cost of grains such as maize and soybeans, Covid-19 pandemic and the lockdown that resulted in devastating losses to farmers, illegal importation of frozen poultry products across the country’s land border, and government policy that banned the importation of maize which accounts for more than 70% of poultry feeds\r\nGlobally, Poultry production is expected to grow faster than the production of other meat products at 1.9% per annum down from 2.6% per annum in the last decade, This rate of growth will help to curb the longer term decline in meat self-sufficiency.

('rabbit', 'Animal protein intake is dismally low in lesser-developed countries (LDC’s) than in developed countries (DC’s). The FAO recommends a minimum of 70 g of protein daily per caput, out of which at least 35 g (50%) should come from animal proteins, but the average Nigerian consumes less than 10 g of protein with only 3.2 g of this amount from animal protein. Pathetically, Nigeria with a population of about 140 million, the highest in Africa, has the highest number of under-five mortality. These deaths occur because of low animal protein intake. To bridge this gap therefore, all reasonable and practical options deserve thorough consideration. Micro-livestock such as the rabbit, guinea pig, grasscutter, giant rat, iguana and pigeons have been suggested Vietmeyer (1984) as a rapid mean of obtaining animal proteins. The rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) appears to be the most sustainable mean of producing high quality animal protein for the expanding populations of the LDC’s like Nigeria. The attributes of rabbits include: affordable or low-cost management requirements, small-bodied size, short generation interval, fecundity, rapid growth rate, genetic diversity, ability to utilize forage and agricultural by-products, and adaptation over a wide range of ecological environments. Nigeria is estimated to have up to 1.7 million rabbits (RIM, 1992)\r\nLivestock production is a socio-economic activity that could lead to improved income and raise the quality of living of Nigerians (Chukwuigwe, Week & Owen, 2008 and Akinola, 2009). There is a global awareness on the level of shortage of animal protein supply in the tropic (Adekunle & Ajani, 1990). Nigeria remains among the least consumers of animal protein in the world (Egbunike, 1997). Average consumption of animal protein in this country is estimated at 4.5g/head/day as against a minimum requirement of 35g/head/day recommended by the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nation (Atsu, 2002). The need to increase livestock production as a means of alleviating the overwhelming shortage of animal protein is very vital to humanity (Fielding, 1981). The demand for protein of animal origin in Nigeria is greater than the supply (Akinmutimi & Onwukwe, 2002). This acute shortage of animal protein in Nigeria demands effort to be directed to livestock that are prolific and have short gestation interval.\r\nRabbit farming which is known as cuniculture is the agricultural practice of breeding and raising domestic rabbits, usually for their meat, fur, or wool. According to Anyanwu, Anyanwu and Anyanwu (2001) the keeping of rabbit as a domestic animal is not yet popular in West Africa probably because its potentialities as a rich source of protein have not been recognized by many. Or because enough awareness of their economic importance and as a business have not been created. Few people keep rabbits as pet animals\r\n', 'Rabbit production in Nigeria is largely a traditional, non-commercially oriented, family-consumption targeted, and smallholder type operation comprising an average of 2-7 does and 3 bucks. About 3.4-5.2% of the Nigerian population may be keeping rabbits with women and children being mostly involved. Rabbit keeping is both intensive and semi¬ intensive, though some scattered free range backyard rearing was recorded. Unlike the rural rabbit keepers, space is limiting for most urban rabbit keepers. Diets of rabbits in Nigeria are primarily forages, grasses and legumes, kitchen wastes while commercial feeds are rarely fed. Bucks and does are under-utilized, with does producing about 20 weaned rabbit per year and are usually offered for sale after four parlties. Nigerian rabbits do not suffer any peculiar disease, however skin disease (mange) and coccidia infection are very common. There are high peri- and post-natal mortalities, and it was estimated that overall mortality between birth and marketing was between 30-40%, being highest in the young ones.\r\nRabbit Farming offer numerous advantages, which are derived from its attributes. These advantages make rabbit farming profitable to farmers. They have a very short gestation period (27-33 days) and can re-breed immediately after littering such that does (female rabbit), if well managed under simple conditions, can produce at least 5litters/year with an average of 6 kids/litter, which is 30kids/doe/year. The productive efficiency of the rabbits is measured by the number of young raised to weaning or slaughter per unit time. The domestic rabbit when compared with other livestock is characterized by early sexual maturity, high prolificacy, relatively short gestation period, short generation interval, high productive potentials, rapid growth, good ability to utilize forages and fibrous plant materials and agricultural by-products, more efficient feed conversion, low cost per breeding female and by its profitability for smallscale system of production and in backyards (Cheeke, 1986; Finzi, & Amici, 1991).\r\nTo produce 1kg of rabbit meat, two hours of labor time is necessary. The return rate of investment was found to be 152% i.e. N1.52 return to every N1.00 invested. That for a fixed cost was 1299% i.e. N12.99 return to every N1.00 incurred on the fixed asset while the rate of return on variable cost was 274.5% that is N2.75 return to every N1.00 invested on variable inputs.\r\n', 'Markets for rabbit meat exist in Nigeria but not organized or festival-targeted. This is unlike beef cattle, sheep, goats, broiler or spent laying chickens and the reason could be the subsistence level of rabbit production. Nonetheless, the increasing popularity of rabbit among the populace is gradually expanding the market for rabbit meat. Rabbits in Nigeria are marketed live or processed by roasting or removal of skin, and cutting into parts. Consumers prefer smoked rabbit probably because it reflects the traditional preparation of game animals. Rabbit meat is not sold in restaurants.', 'Rabbit production in Nigeria is usually subsistence or family-consumption targeted. Rabbit meat is ranked sixth after beef, mutton, goat, meat (chev, on), and bush meat. Rabbit production in Nigeria is described as elementary or emergent.\r\nBeing animals that are widely domesticated in Nigeria, small holder farmers are not in any way restrained from freely participating. Ranging is a popular system of farming in the country. The Sales of these animals can be by several means from personal bargaining to slaughter houses the options is numerous for farmers\r\n', 'Limitations to rabbit production in developing countries include the susceptibility of the animals to heat stress, and the degree of management skill necessary to raise rabbits successfully'),
('renewable energy', 'Nigeria has 12,500 megawatts of installed generation capacity, being largely dependent on natural gas, at 87.5 per cent of the on-grid energy supply mix. This position is rather unsurprising given the nation’s vast gas resources and the relative cost-efficiency of gas-fired power generation. Due to perennial challenges with grid infrastructure and other well-documented constraints to reliable power supply, a large proportion of the economy is reliant on off-grid, captive energy generation, which is for the most part, powered by petrol and diesel.\r\nAs the harmful effects of pollution and greenhouse gas emissions become clearer and the need for sustainable development takes on a more central role in the global energy conversation, there seem to be a consensus among key players across the world that it is imperative to shift focus towards renewable energy (and other clean energy sources) to drive economic growth, not least in developing countries such as Nigeria, where the need for investment is greatest.\r\nThis global paradigm shift, along with various policy initiatives by governments to incentivise renewable energy development and financing has led to an unprecedented growth in renewable energy (especially solar and wind) projects in many countries. Even for a country like Nigeria, where renewable energy has always featured in the energy mix (hydropower accounts for about 12.5 per cent of its on-grid energy), the current trend provides an opportunity to promote and attract sustainable investment in its energy sector.\r\n', '', 'In response to global demand for applications of renewable energy resources, the Energy Commission of Nigeria (ECN) was established in 1979. The Energy Commission now has six centers spread across the country. The centers are:\r\n (1) National center for energy research and development (NCERD) at University of Nigeria, Nsukka. \r\n(2) Sokoto energy research center (SERC) at Usman Dan Fodiyo University, Sokoto. \r\n(3) National center for petroleum research and development (NCPRD), Abubakar Tafawa Balewa University, Bauchi.\r\n (4) National center for energy efficiency and conservation (NCEEC), University of Lagos, Lagos. \r\n(5) National center for hydropower research and development (NCHRD), University of Ilorin, Ilorin. \r\n(6) National center for energy and environment (NCEE), University of Benin, Benin City.\r\n The energy research centers have mandate to conduct researches and develop renewable energy technologies as well as to popularize the applications of renewable energy resources. Nigeria is blessed with abundant quantities of fossil fuel energy sources such as petroleum, natural gas, coal, lignite, tar sands and renewable energy resources. The renewable energy sources include hydropower, solar radiation, wind, fuel wood, animal waste and crop residue. A greater percentage of energy services in domestic, commercial, industrial and 3 transport sectors are provided by petroleum and electricity derived from either burning fossil fuels or hydroplants (Animalu and Adekola, 2002).\r\nhttps://www.osti.gov/etdeweb/servlets/purl/21390205#:~:text=Solar%20radiation%20being%20abundantly%20present,latitudes%20(Ileoje%2C%201997).\r\n', 'Nigeria’s electricity sector is primarily regulated by the provisions of the Electric Power Sector Reform Act 2005 (EPSRA), which among other responsibilities, establishes the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) as the apex sector regulator and authorizes it to make rules, regulations, and policies relating to Nigeria’s electricity sector.\r\nAmong other things, the EPSRA also establishes the Rural Electrification Agency (REA) which is charged with: expanding the main grid; developing isolated mini-grid systems; and promoting renewable energy power generation. The REA is also mandated to set up and administer a Rural Electrification Fund (REF) which is to promote, support and provide rural electrification programs to achieve more equitable regional access to electricity.\r\nhttps://www.ibanet.org/renewable-energy-nigeria\r\n', 'Although there has been growth in the number of renewable projects and investor appetite, the on-grid power sub-sector is still beleaguered with its challenges including technical and collection losses and the lack of a fully cost reflective tariff which creates money making concerns for investors. Furthermore, the prevailing illiquidity in the Nigerian electricity sector creates a vicious cycle as much needed investments cannot be made in the grid infrastructure leading to a continuation of the earlier-described losses.\r\nAnother key challenge arises from the fact that these renewable projects are installed mainly in unserved, rural areas where consumers have lower incomes resulting in power affordability issues. To address the potential revenue risk, developers may need to consider affordable consumer financing structures, connect productive users on site and maintain a balance of productive users and household users who can withstand cycles in the productive users demand for power.\r\nhttps://www.ibanet.org/renewable-energy-nigeria\r\n'),

Some salient infrastructure challenges in the country include:\r\n•	Insufficient road networks linking commercial centers across the country, posing an ongoing challenge to business operation; and\r\n•	An insufficient stock of affordable housing for low-income earners.\r\nConstruction projects in Nigeria are driven by both the government and private investors. The government provides key infrastructure such as roads, bridges, dredged water ways and ports, and railways via several means including full government financing, public-private partnerships (PPPs), multilateral development banks (MDBs), and bilateral creditors. Due to the increasing cost of key infrastructure projects in the country and dwindling government financing, the government has made use of PPPs as a tool to finance projects for which the government was not able to secure debt financing. The GON received Senate approval to begin the process of securing about $22 billion in external loans for key infrastructure projects in the National Infrastructure Master Plan.

('rice', 'Rice is a staple food for more than half of the world’s population, and 90% of the world’s rice comes from Asia. There are thousands of types of rice, but depending on how producers process them, they fit into two groups: white or brown (whole grain). White rice is the most common type, though brown rice offers more health benefits. Brown rice comes in a variety of shades, including reddish, purplish, or black\r\nRice is one of the major staple foods in Nigeria, consumed across all geopolitical zones and socioeconomic classes. Rice consumption is increasing rapidly in Nigeria because of the shift in consumer preference towards rice, increasing population growth, increased income levels, and rapid urbanization. It is commonly boiled and eaten with stew or vegetable soup. It is also used in the preparation of several local dishes that are eaten in every home, especially during festivals and ceremonies. However, rice production falls short of demand; the country depends heavily on rice importation of over 3 million tons annually, equivalent to over US$480 million in scarce foreign exchange. The Nigeria agricultural landscape is changing, with increased government policies aimed at stimulating private sector involvement and boosting local production.\r\n', 'Rice is one of the most consumed staples in Nigeria, with a consumption per capita of 32kg. In the past decade, consumption has increased 4.7%, almost four times the global consumption growth, and reached 6.4 million tonnes in 2017 – accounting for c.20% of Africa\'s consumption. As at 2011, rice accounted for 10% of household food spending, and 6.6% of total household spending*. Given the importance of rice as a staple food in Nigeria, boosting its production has been accorded high priority by the government in the past 7 years. Significant progress has been recorded; rice production in Nigeria reached a peak of 3.7 million tonnes in 2017.\r\nGlobally, rice production has grown at an annual average of 1.0% over the past decade, reaching 486.7 million tonnes in 2017.

Human consumption accounts for about 78% of global production while the balance serves other uses such as feed.\r\nRice is one of the major staple foods in Nigeria, consumed across all geo-political zones and socioeconomic classes in Nigeria. Only about 57% of the 6.7 million metric tonnes of rice consumed in Nigeria annually is locally produced, leading to a supply deficit of about 3 million metric tonnes.\r\nWith rapid growth in the country’s population which is estimated to exceed 200 million by 2019, it is expected that the demand for rice will be sustained and increased in the foreseeable future\r\n tonnes in 2017.\r\n', 'RIFAN (Rice Farmers Association of Nigeria) has the objectives of supporting their members on production, processing and marketing of rice as well as the possibility of supplying inputs at low prices.\r\nRecent governments in Nigeria had placed a lot of premium on the cultivation of the crop. The CBN through its various intervention is supporting both subsistence and commercial farmers. The Federal Government had also banned the importation of Rice in the country leading to increased demand and rise in prices as the local farmers are barely able to meet the demand. There had also been a lot of investment in the procurement and establishment of machinery and setting up processing facilities. \r\n', 'Some problems associated with rice production in Nigeria include: drought, poor soil fertility, pest attack, smuggling, security of farmers, poor post production, broken and inefficient linkages. \r\nOver the past two decades, inconsistency, shifting between open and protectionist trade policy have characterized Nigerian rice policy. Such changes hinder the ability of stakeholders to develop long-term strategies. While trade policy has been viewed as the only option for developing the rice sector, there has been a lack of policy to take advantage of the protection and enhance the domestic sector’s efficiency. In addition, the import ban itself is difficult to enforce, which reduces its efficiency. Key issues for the domestic sector are the availability of inputs and credit, and processing, marketing and quality management. Farmers remain committed to producing rice, despite the lack of inputs, as it is the best crop for the flood-prone lowlands (fadama areas).\r\n'),

He said that there was also poor exploitation practices in rubber plantations. Surviving rubber trees are exploited by untrained and greedy tappers by employing damaging tapping techniques such as slaughter tapping, thus killing rubber trees. There is also the long gestation period of five to seven years for rubber, which serves as a disincentive to smallholders and investors in the commodity.

Instead, shrimps have a hard exoskeleton (the shell of the shrimp)\r\nThe Niger Delta region in Nigeria alone is richly endowed with freshwater, brackish water and marine ecosystems. There are many under-utilized borrow pits, lakes, springs, creeks, and rivers all of which are rich in biodiversity that could be used for shrimp farming.\r\nNigeria is one of the tropical countries that export shrimps to developed countries like USA, Japan, and some European nations.  With a production capacity of 12,000 MT annually, Nigeria’s shrimps are at present entirely wild caught from the Niger Delta. Nigeria has a coastline of approximately 853 km, over  70% of which lies in the delta; the surface area of the continental shelf is 46,300km2  while the Economic Exclusive Zone (EEZ) covers an area of 210,900km2 (World Resources 1990). Comparatively, the coastal shelf of the Niger Delta is broader up to Kwa Iboe and Cross River. This relative space advantage coupled with the rich organic debris input arising from runoff due to frequent rains that characterize the delta basin support rich shrimp resources in and off the coast of the Niger Delta (Dublin-Green and Tobor 1992); though shrimps are also found in abundance at the mouths of Badagry, Lagos, Lekki lagon system\r\nAquaculture is basically a natural ecological process, although in intensive shrimp farming it reaches industrial proportion (Kautsky et al 2000) (also see Quarto et al 1996 for detailed review of the culture methods).  Levels of production, like in other aquaculture production systems, are extensive, semi-intensive, and intensive (even super-intensive), depending on the technological advancement. It is estimated that 55-60% of all shrimp farms worldwide operate at extensive level, 25-30% at semi-intensive level, while the rest are intensive (http://www.fisherymanagement.wikia.com).  Intensive shrimp farming is the option that capitalist investors prefer.  It provides quick return on investment, and collapses within few years due to self-pollution, disease epidemics and isolation from supportive natural ecological services in the seascape.  With a short life span of between 5 and 10 years (Dierbery and Kiattisikulm 1996), intensive shrimp farming is a boom-and-burst industry (Quarto et al 1996; Primavera 1997).

In 2018, Thailand was the biggest shrimp producer with shrimp production of 2.59 million metric tons.\r\n With the steady increase in rates of shrimp consumption in the developed world, especially in the US, Europe and Japan, it is increasingly becoming obvious that per capita shrimp intake probably correlates positively with economic growth (Zabbey 2008). According to the United States Trade Representatives (2005), the global markets for shrimp and prawns are increasing by three percent annually, largely due to increased consumption in the US, Europe and Japan.\r\n', 'The fishery production value chain is very open to new entrants as far as the individual can finance the initial outlay. However there are associations that provide guidance and some support mechanisms to limit failure. Though membership may come at some fee, but then the benefits out ways the cost.

Coastal fishing and others in the Nigerian coastal lines are guided by international laws, thought there are illegal activities of boats but the law is explicitly against this.', 'The threat of disease outbreak arising from self-inflicted poor water quality is one reason why shrimp farming is unsustainable. The risk of disease in shrimp ponds correlates positively with the density of shrimp in the ponds.  In the Philippines for instance, infectious Hypodermal and Hematopoietic Necrosis Virus (IHHNV) prevalence in various wild populations of Penaeus monodon has been correlated with shrimp culture intensification and mangrove status (Belak et al 1999 cited in Kautsky et al 2000). To combat epidemics in shrimp ponds, several non-selective, persistent toxicants are employed which only provide temporary relief to the production system. Toxicant-laden wastewater regularly discharged from shrimp farms causes degradation such as, habitat change and damage, along its tracks in the receiving environment, death of sensitive biodiversity and bioaccumulation in food chain. Additives in shrimp farming such as feeds, fertilizers, lime, antibiotics and other chemicals have the tendency of overwhelming the natural ability of coastal aquatic systems to assimilate and convert these wastes. The fallout is that the ecosystem is upset. In addition, this virulent mixture has the tendency to harm people, as manifested in the incidence of cases of zoonoses (www.greenpeace.org/international/campaigns)\r\nThe major issues affecting shrimp farming in Nigeria are;\r\n>	Lack of knowledge of Shrimp farming\r\n>	Oil spillage\r\n>	Environmental degradation and pollution\r\n>	Lack of tools for mechanized shrimps farming\r\n>	Lack of storage Materials\r\n>	Lack of adequate government assistance\r\n>	Lack of easy access to the international market by most shrimps farmers in Nigeria\r\n>	Poor funding for research activities\r\n>	Lack of capital for large scale production\r\n>	Lack of skilled manpower\r\n');

It is grown in tropical and sub-tropical climates, annual rainfall for optimum germination is 420cm. Just like millet sorghum requires a warm environment to grow well. Nigeria is the largest producer of sorghum in west Africa and third largest after United State and Asia, globally but first in food grain production.\r\nSorghum is also called Guinea Corn Farming, Egyptian millet, Sudan grass etc. Sorghum has more than 30 varieties and hundreds of improved varieties. But the commonly cultivated sorghum in Nigeria and other African countries is Sorghum bicolor because of their outstanding properties.\r\n Furthermore, Sorghum is cultivated in larger quantities in central America, Southern Asia and Africa. While Asia and America grow sorghum mainly for fodder, Africa grow it for food. Guinea corn is a good source of food for the poor rural people, it contains; proteins, vitamins, energy and minerals.\r\nDue to the Sorghum crop’s low maintenance needs, arid and semi-arid temperatures are a perfect fit for it, causing cultivation to be done in several states in Nigeria like Adamawa, Zamfara, Borno, Yobe, Gombe, Niger, Taraba, Sokoto, Katsina, Nasarawa, Plateau, Kebbi, Bauchi, Jigawa, and in several parts of the Northern Nigeria in general.\r\n', 'In addition, Africa Sorghum is used for a number of consumable products such as pap, flour for baking, alcoholic drink, such as beer and non alcoholic drinks, such as malt, porridge etc. Nigeria cultivate sorghum up to 5.6 million hectares of land while annual production is estimated at 2.8 million tonnes. Only 45% of the output is exported while the rest is for local consumption. That is why we need more investors in this area because of the opportunities it offers.\r\nStatistics have shown that over 5.5 million hectares of land in Nigeria is currently occupied with sorghum cultivation which accounts for the production of 2.7 to 2.8 million tonnes annually. Asides that, Nigeria’s sorghum output yielded about 35% overall as at 2007, and in West Africa, the country accounts for about 71% of the sorghum production output.\r\n\r\n', 'Ranking crops that qualify as super foods as well as wealth creating plants, sorghum comes among the top grades. Sorghum is a multipurpose cereal crop whose market value and industry potential is constantly increasing. As food, it is rich in numerous healthy nutrients and also serves as livestock feed as well as providing brewing industry with a major raw material. Other names for sorghum include millet and guinea corn.\r\nThe market potential of sorghum farming and production in Nigeria is enormous. What makes this possible is the great demand for sorghum crops in large amounts for a vast number of purposes.\r\nA wide range of business opportunities within the sorghum farming and production business like breweries, bakeries, and livestock feeds, the market potential of Sorghum crops continue to rise with the increase in demand from businesses operating in these sub-industries.\r\nSome sorghum farming and production business opportunities are:\r\n•	Fodder or Livestock feed\r\n•	Food\r\n•	Beverages\r\n•	Biofuel\r\n', 'NGAN is an agricultural commodity association that develops and promotes standards for guinea corn  production throughout the states of Nigeria.

('sugarcane', 'sugarcane, (Saccharum officinarum), perennial grass of the family Poaceae, primarily cultivated for its juice from which sugar is processed. Most of the world’s sugarcane is grown in subtropical and tropical areas. The plant is also grown for biofuel production, especially in Brazil, as the canes can be used directly to produce ethyl alcohol (ethanol). The by-products from cane sugar processing, namely the straw and bagasse (cane fibres), can be used to produce cellulosic ethanol, a second-generation biofuel. Other sugarcane products include molasses, rum, and cachaça (a Brazilian alcohol), and the plant itself can be used as thatch and as livestock fodder. This article treats the cultivation of the sugarcane plant. For information on the processing of cane sugar and the history of its use, see sugar.\r\nThe sugarcane plant produces a number of stalks that reach 3 to 7 metres (10 to 24 feet) high and bear long sword-shaped leaves. The stalks are composed of many segments, and at each joint there is a bud. When the cane becomes mature, a growing point at the upper end of the stalk develops into a slender arrow bearing a tassel of tiny flowers.\r\n', 'Nigeria sugar cane production was at level of 1.46 million tonnes in 2019, up from 1.43 million tonnes previous year, this is a change of 1.56%.\r\nThe data, generated by the Nigerian Sugar Development Council (NSDC), show that despite the government’s professed efforts to boost local production of sugar, and claims by Dangote Plc and BUA Group to have substantially invested in that programme, the nation has relied almost entirely – over 98 per cent — on the importation of raw sugar for the last 30 years.\r\nThe figures show that successes recorded by industry leaders like Dangote, BUA, and Flour Mills of Nigeria have been anchored more on bringing raw sugar into the country where it is refined and sold, an economically costly model with negative implication for the Naira, job creation, and government revenue.\r\nWhile Nigeria produced 41,478 metric tonnes of sugar in 1990, the figure fell to 38,597 metric tonnes in 2019. Imports rose astronomically from 603,000 metric tonnes in 1990 to 1.6 million metric tonnes during the period, according to the data.\r\n', 'Between 1990 and 2020, the country produced only less than two per cent of the sugar it consumed.\r\nImporters of raw sugar received presidential approvals to ship in up to 1.6 million metric tonnes of raw sugar yearly, while domestic production plummeted. For some years, the quantities approved and imported outpaced national demand.\r\nAs imports rose to millions of metric tonnes, local production of raw sugar in the country fell to 9,850 metric tonnes in 1998, and to zero between 2001 and 2005.\r\nProduction restarted in 2006 at 50,000 metric tonnes and fell again to 5,000 in 2011 and 2013.\r\nAs local production collapsed, importation rose to 1.5 million metric tonnes in 2020, the highest in four years.\r\nIn the last two decades, importation figures were lowest only in 2003, 2004, and 2010, when they fell below the million metric tonnes mark.\r\n', 'The country must therefore get her agricultural policies and strategies right in order to move her economy into high-value sectors that will generate jobs for the future. The fall in the prices of oil and rising unemployment in the country has prompted the need to diversify the economy in general and the agricultural sector in particular. Again, the recession currently being experienced in the the economy indicates the advisability to reposition Nigerian agriculture in an increasingly globalized world. This is to ensure that supply and demand in the sector can take place in such a way as to provide optimum benefits to the economic agents involved, as opposed to the current situation in which Nigeria is serving as suppliers of raw materials to foreign consumers who have considerable influence over the prices of such commodities through a plethora of institutional arrangements. If the agricultural commodity value chains are well developed in Nigeria, substantial part of the rising food demand can be satisfied with domestic production rather than with imports and this could generate considerable gains in income for smallholder producers. the government has set up and mandated research institutes and agencies such as the National Sugar Development Council (NSDC) and Nigeria Cereal Research Institute (NCRI) to facilitate increase in sugarcane production and utilization. The Millennium Village Commission in Jigawa State is a fall out from this initiative. However, many if not all the established institutes have not met the set out objectives.\r\nThe National Sugar Development Council mandates sugar companies to invest in sugar farming and increasingly use locally produced extracts for their refineries, a process called backward integration. In the meantime, the companies are allowed to import extracts based on the scale of their plantation investment\r\n', 'Production risks relate to the possibility that your yield or output levels will be lower than projected.  Major sources of production risks arise from adverse weather conditions such as drought, freezes, or excessive rainfall at harvest or planting. Production risks may also result from damage due to insect pests and disease despite control measures employed, and from failure of equipment and machinery such as an irrigation pump\r\nMarketing risks relate to the possibility that you will lose the market for your products or that the price received will be less than expected.  Lower sales and prices due to increased numbers of competing growers or changing consumer preferences are common sources of marketing risk.  Marketing risks can also arise from loss of market access due to a wholesale buyer or processor relocating or closing, or if a product \r\nFinancial risks relate to not having sufficient cash to meet expected obligations, generating lower than expected profits, and losing equity in the farm.  Sources of financial risk commonly result from production and marketing risks described earlier. In addition, financial risks may also be caused by increased input costs, higher interest rates, excessive borrowing, higher cash demand for family needs, lack of adequate cash or credit reserves, and unfavorable changes in exchange rates fails to meet market standards or packaging requirements\r\nHuman resource risks pertain to risks associated with individuals and their relationships to each other.  These relationships include those with family members, as well as farm employees and customers.  Key sources of human resource risk arise from one of the “three D’s” — divorce, death, or disability. The impact of any of these events can be devastating to a farm.  Human resource risks also include the negative impacts arising from a lack of people management skills and poor communications\r\nIn part, legal risks relate to fulfilling business agreements and contracts. Failure to meet these agreements often carry a high cost.  Another major source of legal risk is tort liability - causing injury to another person or property due to negligence.  Lastly, legal risk is closely related to environmental liability and concerns about water quality, erosion and pesticide use\r\n'),
('textile design and production', 'Textile design is the creation of designs or patterns that appear on knitted, woven, and printed fabrics. It might sound simple, but textile design is a complex combination of artistic skill and modern technology. It includes creating textile structure: deciding what kinds of fibers a textile should be made of or what kinds of threads to weave together for a desired effect. Have you ever noticed how some fabrics feel especially soft and luxurious when you wear them? That\'s not an accident. It\'s textile design.', 'People who work in textile design develop new ideas for fabrics, which may involve coming up with several design samples for clients. Textile designers experiment with color, fabric, and texture, and they follow style trends with an eye on what\'s coming next. Then, they create ideas for fabrics accordingly. Designers tend to focus on one of two primary areas of textile design: textiles used in interiors, for home decorating purposes like upholstery on furniture, curtains, rugs, and carpets; and textiles for clothing and other products. The basic process of designing these textiles is similar. So now, let\'s see how it\'s done.\r\nWhen a textile designer chooses a specific weave or design element, they also have to decide on color, and, if the design is a printed image, the color of the background fabric. There are even people called textile colorists who specialize in consulting on color trends and effects.\r\n', 'Textile is the second demand of the human being and it is essential to be a civilized person.

('tilapia catfish titus', 'In Nigeria, like many coastal developing countries, fish is an important source of food for the population, which is currently estimated at 186 million people (World Bank 2016). A recent study estimated that Nigeria ranks third globally for the number of people dependent on coastal fisheries for food and nutrition security, and the demand for fish is growing, alongside growth in population and incomes. However, household fish consumption in Nigeria—measured at 13.3 kg/capita/year—is low compared with the world’s average of 20.3 kg/capita/year (FAO 2018). This national average likely masks a much lower average among resourcelimited and vulnerable population groups as well as a notable supply-demand gap. Increased fish production and consumption may contribute to alleviating food and nutrition insecurity. The majority of households in Nigeria (58%) suffer from chronic or transitory food insecurity (Ogundari 2017). In 2016, 14.3 million people in Nigeria were classified as undernourished (FAOSTAT 2017). An average of 67% of children aged 6–23 months living with their mothers did not eat foods rich in iron, and 52% did not eat vitamin A-rich foods in a 24-hour diet recall (NPC and ICF 2014). As a result, fish—which is rich in micronutrients such as zinc, iron, iodine, calcium, vitamin B12 and vitamin A, as well as essential fatty acids and protein—could play an instrumental role in attaining food and nutrition security. Consumer behavior and demographic drivers. Complex sociocultural and behavioral factors influence fish consumption. Food taboos, and community and household perceptions of different species of fish also affect decisions around fish consumption. In Nigeria, households in the southern region eat more fish than those in the northern region. Similarly, household fish consumption is higher in urban than rural areas, and people of higher socioeconomic status consume fish more often than those of lower status. As incomes grow in Nigeria, demand for fish is predicted to increase. Missing from the nationally representative data on fish consumption is information on the species consumed. A variety of species are eaten in Nigeria, including crayfish, sardines (freshwater and saltwater), bonga and mackerel, as well as cultured fish species, such as tilapia, carp and catfish. Food taboos influence fish consumption in Nigeria, especially the dietary behaviors of pregnant women in some groups. For example, pregnant women are advised not to eat the head of dried salted cod (stock fish) because it is believed that if they do, their children will look like stock fish. These practices, though important to society and culture, can lead to misconceptions and undervaluation of the nutritional quality of foods. Taste, texture and convenience-based preferences are also significant factors to consider when analyzing consumer behavior.', 'Fish and fisheries are an integral part of most societies and make important contributions to economic and social health and well-being in many countries and areas. It has been estimated that approximately 12.5 million people are employed in fishery-related activities, and in recent years global production from capture fisheries has tended to vary between approximately 85 and 90 million tonnes. The products from these fisheries are used in a wide variety of ways, ranging from subsistence use to international trade as highly sought-after and highly-valued items. The value of fish traded internationally is approximately US$40 billion per year.\r\nIn Nigeria, fish is commonly processed, mostly by women, using traditional postharvest techniques to preserve, improve flavor and add value to the fish. Common processing techniques include salting, sun-drying, smoking and frying. These methods vary among the individuals involved, depending on infrastructure, fish species, knowledge and wealth. Other value addition products have been documented, such as fish cakes and fish cake burgers made from shrimp by-catch, and developed by fishers as an entrepreneurial endeavor (DFID and FAO 2002). There is no indication that the products were made with the intention of providing nutritional benefits or whether they were locally accepted. The government of Nigeria is interested in promoting nutrition-sensitive agriculture and aquaculture, but programs remain resource-constrained. However, nongovernmental organizations (NGO) are supporting the Ministry of Health, via the Scaling Up Nutrition (SUN) Business Network, to assist small and medium enterprises to become more nutrition-sensitive. This is part of Nigeria’s efforts to address the multiple burdens of malnutrition through the private sector, of which fisheries and aquaculture could play a large part.\r\n', 'With an estimated annual per caput fish consumption of 13.3 kg in 2013, fish represents an important dietary element and one of the few sources of animal protein available to many Nigerians. In 2015, the total fisheries production was estimated at 1 027 000 tonnes, to which marine catches contributed 36 percent, inland waters catches contributed 33 percent and aquaculture 31 percent. Fishery sector contributed to 0.5 percent of national GDP in 2015.\r\n\r\nMore than 80 percent of Nigeria’s total domestic production is generated by artisanal small-scale fishers from coastal, inshore, creeks of the Niger Delta, lagoons, inland rivers and lakes. The small migratory bonga (Ethmalosa fimbriata) is the principal catch. Some initial progress has been made in developing an industrial fisheries sector, but the fleet and infrastructure are ageing. The main species from marine capture fisheries are sardinella.\r\n\r\nWith total fish imports amounting to about USD 1.2 billion and exports valued at USD 284 390 million in 2013, Nigeria is a net importer of fishery products. Fishing is a major source of livelihood. In 2014, 713 036 were reported as engaged in inland fisheries with 21% of this total women. 15% of the total 764 615 people engaged in other fisheries were women in 2014.The aquaculture sector is driven by the private sector, with feed and seed provided by private business. Owing to recent significant investments of private capital and a renewed political will to empower the private sector in the area of aquaculture development, Nigeria is the largest aquaculture producer in Sub-Saharan Africa and this importance is steadily increasing. From 21 700 tonnes in 1999, aquaculture production has grown steadily to 316 700 tonnes in 2015 according to the government report. Catfish, typically grown in ponds and tanks, is the most farmed species in Nigeria, constituting over half of the total aquaculture production by volume.

('tomato', 'Tomato comes from the kingdom Plantae, family Solanacaea and the genus, Solanium. Its botanical name is Lycopersicon esculentum.\r\nThe word “tomato” may refer to the plant or the edible, typically red, fruit that it bears. Having originated in America, the tomato was spread around the world following the Spanish colonization of the Americas, and its many varieties are now widely grown, often in greenhouses in cooler climates.\r\nThe tomato is consumed in diverse ways, including raw, as an ingredient in many dishes and sauces, and in drinks. While it is botanically a fruit, it is considered a vegetable for culinary purposes. The fruit is rich in lycopene which may have beneficial health effects.\r\nThe tomato belongs to the nightshade family. The plants typically grow to 1–3 meters (3–10 ft) in height and have a weak stem that often sprawls over the ground and vines over other plants. It is a perennial in its native habitat, although often grown outdoors in temperate climates as an annual. An average common tomato weighs 102–105 grams.\r\nTomato has been in cultivation in Nigeria for a very long time. It is an important component of the daily diet, consumed both fresh and in paste form.\r\nThere are many vegetable fruits recognized in Nigeria, but, Tomato, as a vegetable fruit is a major food component, an ingredient utilized by every house hold and constitutes the national food security programme. The record confirmed that Nigeria produces approximately 1.8 million metric tons fresh fruits for domestic consumption, with national demand of about 2-3 million metric tons annually with demand gap of about 500,000metric tons.[ii]\r\n', 'Tomato has been in cultivation in Nigeria for a very long time. It is an important component of the daily diet, consumed both fresh and in paste form. The production is beset with many problems, such as diseases, nematodes, insect pests, high flower drop, all these resulting in low yield and poor quality fruits.\r\nNigeria is the largest producer of tomatoes in sub-Saharan Africa with an annual yield of 1.8 million metric tonnes, mostly produced in the north. Tomato farmers in Katsina State are angry at the lack of preservation technology for their produce. Their method of storing the perishable fruit out in the open exposes the produce to wind, flies and other natural threats. With its annual production of 1.8 million metric tonnes of tomatoes Nigeria falls short of domestic demand for 2.4 million metric tonnes per annum. Some private companies have started setting up tomato processing plants, but they have yet to make any real impact.\r\n>	The recent production capacity of 2.3 million metric tonnes indicates an increase of 27.8%, from the corresponding figure recorded in 2018.\r\n>	Despite being one of the largest producers of tomatoes in the world, Nigeria is also one of the world’s net importers of tomato paste, placing 13th globally and 3rd in Africa.\r\n>	This fact was corroborated in a research by the Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition titled ‘’Landscape analysis of dried tomato production and market in Nigeria’’, which stated that over 45% of fresh tomato produced in Nigeria is lost due to poor handling practices and other logistics issues\r\n', 'Though Nigeria is currently producing 2.3 million metric tonnes as against 1.8 million produced two years ago, more needs to be done to meet the three million metric tonnes national demand.\r\nTomato production in Nigeria is still short of what is demanded particularly during the second and third quota of the year. While about three million metric tonnes is the national requirement, about 2.3 metric tonnes are produced\r\nThis is another indication or figure pointing to the rate of tomatoes consumption in Nigeria. If Nigeria, after ranking the 14th tomatoes producer in the world and the 2nd in the African continent, and yet still  importing an average of 150, 000 metric tons of concentrate tomatoes paste annually, which off course, is valued at about $170 US million dollar some few years ago, then, it is simple to determined the rate of tomatoes consumption in Nigeria.\r\nIn fact, as a result the Central Bank of Nigeria of late has indeed, expressed concern and worry over such whooping sum of money, the N11.7 billion naira Nigeria has spent to import over 65, 809 metric tons of processed concentrated tomatoes paste abroad.\r\n', 'The National Horticultural Research Institute(NIHORT) is a government agencies charged  with the responsibilities of improving the production, processing and managing tomato production in Nigeria through cutting edge research studies.

Tomatoes are first raised in the nurseries before they enter the field. The nursery supplies, greenhouse, fertilizers, and seeds are not cheap in Nigeria. Most of them are not produced in our country. So, farmers have problems with buying them.\r\n3. Transportation problems. Nigerian farmers usually put tomatoes in baskets. These baskets can be packed on the top of each other. Which means that the lower layers of tomatoes get crushed. Every third tomato is destroyed this way.\r\n4. Marketing challenges .

('tubers', 'Production and consumption of root and tuber staples such as cassava, yams, cocoyams and sweet potatoes can furnish large quantities of food energy per unit area of land under climatic conditions that do not favour dry land cereals production. It is now being increasingly realized that inadequacy of food calories in diets, as well as protein deficiency, contributes to malnutrition in Nigeria. Root and tuber crops are in demand in trade between Nigeria and neighbouring West African countries and also overseas, and they therefore contribute to foreign exchange earnings. There is therefore a strong case for giving greater prominence to root and tuber crops development in the national agricultural planning in Nigeria to meet both nutritional and economic needs.\r\nCassava is grown from stem cuttings and cultivated both as a sole crop and mixed with other crops. It has become ubiquitous and a popular staple crop in many parts of the country because of its hardiness. Cassava may mature for harvesting from 6 months to 2 years under the range of possible growing conditions. Sweet cassava yields are generally lower than those of bitter cassava. Low yields, which are general, are partly due to poor agricultural extension services. Cassava products include gari, sun-dried cassava flour and starch. Yam production is expensive in terms of planting materials and labour. The crop is propagated by yam setts which are mainly the tops of yam tubers which, if not used for propagation, could have been eaten. About 1,680 Ibs per acre of planting setts are required. Average time of maturity is 8 months and during the whole growing period the yam vines have to be supported above ground by wooden poles. Soil fertility, the amount and distribution of rainfall, the size of the setts used, crop management, the cultivar of yam and whether it is grown as a sole crop or in mixed stands all affect yields. Recently yam yields have tended to decrease mainly due to indiscriminate use of poor soils to grow yam and poor management practices. Sweet potato receives systematic planting and proper crop management in the North, but not in the Southern parts of the country. In the South the crop is found growing on refuse heaps around dwellings and not in well-ordered plots. Both Colocasia and Xanthosoma cocoyams are widely grown in Southern Nigeria either as sole crops or mixed with others. Substantial cocoyam production is from roadside plots, and from palm oil and cocoa plantations since they can thrive without proper crop management. Yields are generally low. Irish potatoes are grown mainly in 3enue-Plateau State and Kano and North-Central State.\r\nNigeria is by far the world’s largest producer of yams, accounting for over 70–76 percent of the world production. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization report, in 1985, Nigeria produced 18.3 million tonnes of yam from 1.5 million hectares, representing 73.8 percent of total yam production in Africa.[1] According to 2008 figures, yam production in Nigeria has nearly doubled since 1985, with Nigeria producing 35.017 million metric tonnes with value equivalent of US$5.654 billion. In perspective, the world\'s second and third largest producers of yams, Côte d\'Ivoire and Ghana, only produced 6.9 and 4.8 million tonnes of yams in 2008 respectively. According to the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture, Nigeria accounted for about 70 percent of the world production amounting to 17 million tonnes from land area 2,837,000 hectares under yam cultivation.[4][5]\r\n\r\nYam is in the class of roots and tubers that is a staple of the Nigerian and West African diet, which provides some 200 calories of energy per capital daily. In Nigeria, in many yam-producing areas, it is said that \"yam is food and food is yam\". However, the production of yam in Nigeria is substantially short and cannot meet the growing demand at its present level of use. It also has an important social status in gatherings and religious functions, which is assessed by the size of yam holdings one possesses\r\n', 'In 2019, roots and tubers production for Nigeria was 117 million tonnes. Roots and tubers production of Nigeria increased from 23.8 million tonnes in 1970 to 117 million tonnes in 2019 growing at an average annual rate of 3.78%.\r\nAbout 70 percent of the world\'s yams are produced in Africa4 and about half of the world\'s yams are produced in Niqeria. Accordinq to Phillips16 some yams are indigenous to West Africa and some are introduced. Coursey3 and Irvine12 both agree that the white yam (Dio,eorea rotundata) and the yellow yam (Dioseorea eayenensis) are indigenous to West Africa. A wild form of the yellow yam occurs in West Africa2. The writers support these, but also consider that the water yam (D. alata) the bitter yam (D. dume• torum) and the potato yam, or air potato (D. bulbifera) are indigenous. We have ourselves seen wild forms of these species in Nigeria, and there are local names for both the cultivated and edible yams and for their wild forms. The Chinese yam however, also known as the \'lesser yam\' (D. eseulenta) is an alien in Africa and is believed to have originated in the Indo-Chinese region. The Chinese yam is now grown and eaten, particularly in the Western State of Nigeria. According to Irvine\" who has reviewed evidence for the origin and distribution of cocoyams, the wild ancestor of cultivated cocoyams has never been traced, and cocoyams are considered to be one of man\'s earliest food crops. Evidence suggests that cocoyams originated in Asia, were grown in India for centuries, taken to Egypt at the time of Christ, then to Europe, and then back to North Africa and reached West Africa across the desert\'2. Two species of cocoyam (Coloeasia eseulenta and Xanthosoma saggitifolia) are now grown in Nigeria and many other parts of tropical Africa. The Spaniards found the Indians of Central and South America already growing sweet potatoes in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. They are now an important crop in Northern Nigeria. Three recognized market categories are \'white\', \'red\', and \'yellow\'. Irish potatoes originated in the Andean highlands. They were first introduced into Nigeria during World War II. Their cultivation is increasing in small-scale farms, particularly in areas of Northern Nigeria.\r\nIn West and Central Africa tubers are planted between February and April, depending on whether in humid forest or on the savanna, and are harvested 180 to 270 days later. Care is needed during harvesting to minimize damage to tubers that lead to rot and a decrease in market value. Harvested tubers normally stay dormant (do not develop sprouts) for 30 to 120 days depending on environmental conditions, the date of harvest, and the species. This means that only one crop cycle is possible per year, possibly restricting supply.\r\n', 'Dried cassava roots are being exported to Europe for making starch and the roots have been suggested as raw materials for manufacturing glucose or power alcohol. Cassava chips are also used for animal feeds. In recent years there has been increased exportation of gari, yams and sweet potatoes to England and other overseas countries for sale to immigrant populations. As well as becoming a useful source of foreign exchange earnings, the growth of international trade in roots and tubers increases effective demand for farm food produce and this needs to be matched by an increase in production if it is not to effect adversely the availability of produce for internal consumption.\r\nTuber is the main part of the yam plant which has high carbohydrate content (low in fat and protein) and provides a good source of energy. Unpeeled yam has vitamin C. Yam, sweet in flavour, is consumed as boiled yam (as cooked vegetable) or fufu or fried in oil and then consumed. It is often pounded into a thick paste after boiling and is consumed with soup. It is also processed into flour for use in the preparation of the paste. Its medicinal use as a heart stimulant is attributed to its chemical composition, which consists of alkaloids of saponin and sapogenin. Its use as an industrial starch has also been established as the quality of some of the species is able to provide as much starch as in cereals\r\nWorldwide yam production in 2007 amounted to 52 million tons, of which Africa produced 96%. Most of the world’s production comes from West Africa representing 94%, with Nigeria alone producing 71%, equalling more than 37 million tons. African countries imported more than 2,000 tons in 2002, and exported 15,500, of which Nigeria exported 12%. Yam tubers consist of about 21% dietary fiber and are rich in carbohydrates, vitamin C and essential minerals. Worldwide annual consumption of yams is 18 million tons, with 15 million in West Africa. Annual consumption in West Africa is 61 kilograms per capita. Yams are boiled, roasted, baked or fried. In Africa they are also mashed into a sticky paste or dough after boiling\r\n', 'The National Association of Yam Farmers, Processors and Marketers (CAC/IT/No. 94958) was first incorporated by the Corporate Affairs Commission as Association of Yam Farmers, Processors and Marketers on 22nd day of February, 2017.\r\nFollowing the meeting of yam stakeholders which took place on Thursday, 20th July, 2017 at the Block C Conference Hall of the Federal Ministry of Industry, Trade and Investment (FMITI) with the Director (Commodities and Products Inspectorate), a decision was taken to change the name of the Association to reflect a national umbrella body. Here are some responsibilities of the association, which is similar to all tubers: \r\n•	To promote the business of Yam value chain throughout the country.\r\n•	To collaborate with the Federal Government to transform the traditional methods of farming to mechanized systems.\r\n•	To organize and encourage group/cooperative farming systems.\r\n•	To supervise the proper distribution and use of Agribusiness facilities from Government, Banks and other institutions amongst members.\r\n•	To liaise with the Government on all matters regarding Yam subsector.\r\n•	To encourage members to produce and purchase Yam products for processing and marketing from the members.\r\n•	To organize Annual Yam and its value chain DAY\r\nNational Root Crops Research Institute, Umudike. Is to research into genetic improvement, production, processing, storage and socio-economics of root and tuber crops of economic importance (Yam, Cassava, Potato, Sweetpotato, Cocoyam, Ginger, Hausa Potato (Solenostemon Rotindifolinus), Sugerbeet, Radish, Rizga, And Amora (Arrow Root) )\r\n', 'Agricultural extension services in Nigeria are not at present effective. Peasant farmers tend to use land of poor soil fertility for crop production and this limits yields. Also, they tend to plant their crops without any regard to optimum cropping patterns and seasons, so that poor harvests and crop failures are usual in many Nigerian farming communities. There is a need for general education of Nigerian farmers in improved crop cultivation.\r\nThe major pests that affect yams include insects such as leaf and tuber beetles, mealy bugs, and scales; parasitic nematodes; fungi causing anthracnose, leaf spot, leaf blight, and tuber rot; and viruses, especially the yam mosaic virus (YMV).\r\n'),
('waste management', 'Nigeria generates more than 32 million tons of solid waste annually, out of which only 20-30% is collected. Reckless disposal of MSW has led to blockage of sewers and drainage networks, and choking of water bodies. Most of the wastes is generated by households and in some cases, by local industries, artisans and traders which litters the immediate surroundings.\r\nImproper collection and disposal of municipal wastes is leading to an environmental catastrophe as the country currently lack adequate budgetary provisions for the implementation of integrated waste management programs across the States.\r\n', 'An examination of the current solid waste management in Lagos reveals a similar trend to other regions of Nigeria. However, some improvements have been made in the city. Ezeah and Roberts (2013) noted that Lagos state has made some significant progress in growing institutional capacity for solid waste management. Solomon (2009) observed that Lagos is one of the few states in Nigeria that provide collection service from house to house and communal collection points. He reported that the state commissioned a transfer loading system, to serve several areas of the state.', 'The continuous increase in population in nigeria brings about increase in waste generated daily, which often leads to indiscriminate waste dumping across the metropolis, and this increases demand for collection and logistics in general as against the man power part-time. See, if a large number of people in a given environment are unplanned for, this affects the use of resources especially when such people are uneducated and unenlightened about managing their waste.\r\nhttp://www.nasajournal.com.ng/journal_articles/vol_11/issue_2/paper_6.pdf\r\n', 'National Environmental Standards and Regulations Enforcement Agency (also known as NESREA) is an environmental agency of the Federal Government of Nigeria that was established by law in 2007 to \"ensure a cleaner and healthier environment for Nigerians\"', 'As such, they do pose specific threats in their handling procedure. For example, improper disposal of solid wastes cannot only cause direct spreading of infectious diseases, but also indirect threats which include fermentation and thus, the attraction of various disease spreading factors.'),
('wheat', 'Wheat is one of the world’s most commonly consumed cereal grains.\r\nIt comes from a type of grass (Triticum) that is grown in countless varieties worldwide.\r\nBread wheat, or common wheat, is the primary species. Several other closely related species include durum, spelt, emmer, einkorn, and Khorasan wheat.\r\nWhite and whole-wheat flour are key ingredients in baked goods, such as bread. Other wheat-based foods include pasta, noodles, semolina, bulgur, and couscous.\r\nWheat is highly controversial because it contains a protein called gluten, which can trigger a harmful immune response in predisposed individuals.\r\nHowever, for people who tolerate it, whole-grain wheat can be a rich source of various antioxidants, vitamins, minerals, and fiber.\r\nWheat is a cereal widely cultivated in many countries. It is typically milled into flour which is then used to make a wide range of foods including bread, noodles, pasta, biscuits, cakes, pastries, crisp-breads, among others. It is relatively high in protein compared to other major grains, experts say.\r\nIn Nigeria, wheat is grown mostly in Borno, Bauchi, Yobe, Kano, Jigawa, and Zamfara States\r\n', 'On average, the country produced just 2.06 per cent of the total amount of wheat consumed during that period. The figures largely explain why the prices of wheat-related products, including bread and pastry, have consistently risen in the country.\r\nThe data show that while Nigeria produced 60 tonnes of wheat in each of 2018, 2019 and 2020, the domestic consumption of the commodity in those years stood at 4760, 4900 and 4319 tonnes respectively.\r\nSince 2020, prices of the other non-wheat-based staples such as rice, garri, yam, and beans have risen sharply by 21.4percent, 114percent, 26percent, and 67percent, respectively, while the prices of wheat derivative foods have been largely cushioned from the inflationary trend by local millers who continuously absorb the extra cost of production to keep feeding the population.\r\nBread, a widely consumed staple food produced from wheat, is an example of how the wheat millers work assiduously to ensure accessibility and affordability of quality food to the millions of Nigerians struggling to cushion the effect of the protracted harsh economic conditions and inflationary trend.\r\nAn average of 10 million loaves of bread is produced daily in Nigeria. While every other commodity has increased in price by over 50percent, bread prices have only increased by 28percent.\r\nThe Flour Milling Association of Nigeria (FMAN), which is composed of Flour Mills of Nigeria, Olam Nigeria, Dangote Flour Mills, Honeywell Flour, Life Flour Mills, Pure Flour Mills and BUA Flour Mills has continuously supported local wheat production in Nigeria over the past 4 years with interventions totalling about NGN 250 million. These interventions include; NGN 20 million grant to the Lake Chad Research Institute (LCRI) to aid research on improved technology, varietal testing and modern agronomy practices in the year 2016. FMAN also donated 50 units of multi-crop threshers to the Wheat Farmers Association of Nigeria (WFAN) in 2018 to help reduce post-harvest loss, and most importantly, guaranteed offtake to purchase everything produced that meet set criteria. Previously, FMAN also donated 2,500 water pumps and 225,000 kg of seeds to farmers\r\nThis year, FMAN began an outgrower program, working with its long-time partner WFAN, along with Tabanni Wheat Farmers Cooperative and Thrive Agric, to support 400 wheat farmers in Kano, Jigawa and Sokoto states. FMAN has provided a loan of high-yielding Norman seeds, fertilizers and chemicals to each farmer, along with agronomic support, to be repaid with grain at the end of the season. Additionally, FMAN contracted 25 hectares of Norman seed production and conducted research trials with Lake Chad Research Institute (LCRI) to test durum wheat varieties for use in pasta production. The goal is to maximize the yields of wheat farmers – to improve their income, improve volumes in the country and eventually bring prices closer to international levels.\r\n', 'The country produces less than five per cent of the yearly needs, putting pressure of foreign exchange as over 90 per cent of wheat consumed locally is imported. The US Department of Agriculture’s data says Nigeria produces about 60,000 metric tonnes, and yearly demand stands at between 4.5 and 5.0 million tonnes. Wheat is the second highest contributor to Nigeria’s food import bill, according to the CBN, mounting pressure on foreign reserves. He added that over $2 billion was spent yearly on the importation of over 5.0 million metric tonnes of wheat.', 'Wheat Farmers Association of Nigeria (WFAN) working with other association like the FMAN sees itself as a partner of progress in achieving the government’s objective of fixing the wheat value chain, and has taken an active role in the solution, beyond providing offtake. This is apparent in the drive to increase farmer profitability through giving technical support to the farmers and increasing the supply of high-yielding heat-tolerant wheat seeds. As the baking quality of Nigerian wheat improves, yields rise and prices come closer to import levels, FMAN looks forward to increasing its offtake of Nigerian wheat, while ensuring sustainable flour prices for Nigerian consumers', 'Today, the challenges facing wheat production in the country include limited access to improved seed varieties, fertilizers & chemicals, high cost of production, inadequate irrigation infrastructure, insufficient funding systems, lack of a cohesive national strategy on wheat development, and the unclear role of various stakeholders');
